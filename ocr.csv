Responding to Slmiy’s updated response at 11:30:

How dare you brush off our collective experiences so easily!! Why do you think so many people drop? Why nat look into the source of the problem
dammit!

You put the weight of us leaming the material entirely on ourselves. You're insinuation is that the professor reinforces things weve taught ourselves instead
of us being TAUGHT by TEACHERS. With more teachers doing that, we're all running out of time for us to teach ourselves or do ANYTHING outside of
class. Teach us what we need to know, but with enough time for us to leam and use it practically! cant get right to work after learning a new concept. |
have a mountain of other crap as well

If you'e just going to brush this off that easily, then | only have one more thing to say: ""@) Youve lost my respect and also civility”

~ HW complaint

hope I'm not alone here, but I don't feel we're given enough time to digest and study the material necessary to complete the homework before it's due. The
necessary concepts seem to be gone over just a couple days before the due date and the HW questions are more complex than what we've gone over in class. Only
hhaving a couple days to internalize and level up our understanding is not only stressing me out but making me sad everytime Im missing a litte bit of info that keeps
me from finishing near the end

‘Are you guys freshmen? This class isn't hard... @ and pretty much everything weve done so far was covered in physics 240 (which is a prereq). Maybe

 [BD the instructors’ answer, where insructors collectively construct single answer

Historically, some students may end up having to drop the class after the second midterm. The standards ofthis class have already been set, so try to keep up.
The complexity ofthis class will help you sunive future courses such as 311, 413, 622. you are into circuits, you will nat stop at 215,

Try to read the textbook to help with the digestion and go to office hours for help on homework.

There are resources such as tutoring available at Michigan to help you, but the mention of tutoring here is neither a recommendation nor an endorsement

Its come to our attention that Canvas sends a notification every time we start a Zoom
office hours session, and that the volume of notifications is overwhelming for some.
Unfortunately, this is automatic, and there is no way for the instructional team to turn
these off for you. However, you ean adjust your Canvas notification settings!

Be aware that changing notification settings in Canvas affects al/ your courses,
not just STATS 250. These instructions are provided for informational purposes
only. You can make the decision to turn off these notifications on your own
accord and accept any responsibility for consequences of any missed
notifications, either in this course or others.

Here's how to do it:

1. On the Canvas webpage, click your profile picture on the left side of the
screen, then click Notifications:

Scroll to the section called Scheduling. Note that the screenshot may have slightly
different options than those that are available to you.

Change the Calendar setting
STATS 250.

* The first four icons control your email settings. If the checkmark option is,
selected, you'll receive an email every time an event is created, modified, or
deleted (this is what you probably don't want). The clock icon (highlighted in
green, second-to-left) will reduce all Canvas calendar notifications to a ""daily
digest” sent via email. The calendar icon will send a weekly digest. The X
turns off all emails.

+ The second two icons control push notification settings if you have the
Canvas app on your mobile device. You can elect to turn these on or off only.

The STATS 250 Instructional Team will no longer send announcements about office
hours. You can view the schedule of office hours here. MWrite office hour notifications
will still be delivered via announcements, though those will end this week.

How is race seen? How is it unseen? Is it primarily a visual experience? What
does the aspiration to be “colorblind” imply about the nature of race and
sensory processes in society? How are racial objects and associations discerned
multi-sensorially? How are sensory practices and habits themselves shaped by
social, linguistic, cultural, and historical forces?

This seminar explores how ways people think about the senses are connected to
the construction of racial logics, and vice versa. Walking into the exciting world
of the anthropology of the senses, students explore how social and cultural
contexts shape practices of sense perception, and how different societies and
eras have varied sensory orderings.

Offered during a historical moment marked by mass movements for racial
justice across the globe, this seminar is designed to inspire creative approaches
to the question of race and racial discrimination. The course will fulfill the
LSA requirements for Social Studies (SS) and Race and Ethnicity (R&E) Credit.

A student who is enrolled in an in-person or hybrid class with you at the University has recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 after being tested at an extemal, off-campus health facility. The University received this information
from the county where the test was taken and confirmed. If you attended an in-person class with this student, your risk is likely low due to current face covering policies, social distancing, and cleaning protocols for academic
facilities. Please note that, in an effort to protect privacy, details regarding positive cases in classrooms will not be shared or posted.

‘We are notifying you of this incident as part of our public health notification protocol so you are aware of positive COVID-19 cases on campus and potential exposures. Our office, working in conjunction with the health department,
has conducted a risk assessment to determine who may have been in close contact with the infected individual and has provided specific instructions to those identified if quarantine is required. If you were not directly contacted by a
U-M Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) contact tracer, there is no increased risk of exposure, and there is no need to quarantine.

COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within 6 feet) for a prolonged period of time (at least 15 minutes). Spread can occur when an infected person coughs, sneezes,
talks, or sings, and droplets from their mouth or nose are released into the air and land on nearby people or surfaces. However, risk of spread is greatly reduced by wearing masks, social distancing, hand washing, and staying home
when sick.

If you develop symptoms concerning for COVID-19, you should be assessed by a medical professional. Please call your primary care provider, or do the following:

at individual level as well as at universal level. The peace will appear if fear for
the punishment of injustice or sin is realized by every human being. This fear of
punishment for the sin is to be exhibited by the government of any state or
country. But the sinners are escaping the punishments for sins through the
extraordinary intelligence of advocates and sometimes through corruption
existing in the controlling agencies like courts and police stations.

News regarding Professor Peter
Chen

 

| am writing to share that Professor Peter Chen will resume his duties as
a professor in the division of Computer Science and Engineering. As
you may know, Professor Chen has been on administrative leave since
January of 2021. He was recently found not guilty in criminal allegations
by a jury in Washtenaw County.

Professor Chen will resume his duties on 13 January 2023. President
Ono, Provost McCauley and | are supportive of this action.

Michigan Engineering is committed to fostering an environment where
every member of our community feels valued, connected and informed.
We recognize that some members of our community may have
questions regarding Professor Chen's return to CSE. If you have specific
questions, please reach out to Department Chair Michael Wellman. In
addition, students can contact the Engineering CARE Center, and
faculty and staff members can contact the Prevention Education,
Assistance and Resources Office (PEAR) to set up an individual
conversation.

Thank you, and | hope you have a productive start to the new term.

Jam standing in the Blood Bank at Michigan Medicine in Ann Arbor. | am looking at
the refrigerator that contains only one day's supply of blood for the hospital.

‘The hospital {s full, There are patients who need blood and cannot wait. Some have
leukemia. Some are bleeding. Some are infants born with heart disease who will die
ifthey do not have surgery. And, yes, some have COVID.

We are facing a blood crisis. Blood donations have plummeted. Organizations have
cancelled blood drives. Donors are just not showing up to collection centers. This is
entirely unnecessary.

‘There are understandable and legitimate reasons why some people cannot donate.
Ifyou have a fever, cough, or shortness of breath, or have traveled to an at-risk
county or been diagnosed or had close contact with a person with COVID-19 in the
past 28 days, you should not donate blood. But if you are healthy and able to donate
there is no reason why you cannot go out and donate.

Blood donation sites are safe. The donors are screened and healthy people. The staff
are also screened and healthy people. Blood centers have always followed strict
hygiene protocols. Blood donation sites are safer than most homes.

In this time of worry and stress we need calm and reasoned responses. | have an
appointment to donate blood tomorrow morning. Will you join me?

Hello all,

I've been thinking a lot about the killings in Atlanta and how this along with the multitude of other truly terrible things that have occurred this past year
might be affecting you. An email is not my preferred way to communicate about this and | truly wish in this moment that we were in person. Please
know that | recognize that this event, along with the many anti-Asian violence and other racist acts of aggression this past year, have made things
incredibly difficult for many of you. | hope that if you need support in any way you feel free to reach out to me. | may not be a person you trust or who.
is equipped to help in the way that is most needed. If that is the case, | can help find someone who is.

| hope that this communication does not come across as yet another empty gesture, from someone in a position of relative power who says things
without doing anything. | certainly don’t claim to have everything figured out, but here are things | can do:

- | alone am unable to change policies, but | will promise to bring your questions and concerns to the attention of the department and apply pressure
so as to ensure your voices are heard and appropriate action is taken;

- | will extend deadlines for those of you affected by these events, or other things going on in your lives;

- | will excuse you from or reschedule class meetings for you to seek the support you need

- regards,

Writing about global politics for a goddamn student
publication is not accomplishing anything and, even if you
did somehow bring more attention to an issue someone didn't
know about, your opinion on what NATO should fucking do
means jack shit. Please write about your dating life or the
memes about the smell of EECS students instead of being
some faux, de facto policy advisor for people who will never
actually be in positions of significant power.

Every college town has a parasitic
restaurant—expensive, mediocre,
fussy, pretentious—that, thanks to
inertia and location, survives as the
path of least resistance for faculty
dinners.

Its only virtue is furnishing a good
metaphor for everything else wrong
with academia.

But in winter, cold or freezing
temperatures make branches stiffer
and more brittle - and more likely to
break, bend, or fall when covered
with a heavy load of snow or ice.
Winter snow and ice can also pack into
every nook and cranny of your tree's
crown, making it heavier and potentially
destabilizing the tree. Feb 23, 2021

3449,"Standby Line and Overflow Room for Ben Shapiro

If you are receiving this email, that means you are on the waitlist for Ben
Shapiro's speech at Rackham Auditorium on November 15. At this point, your
chance of securing a ticket is quite low, BUT YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE
AT GETTING IN!

There will invariably be people who reserved tickets and don't show up and
others who reserved them simply to suppress turnout. Because of this, we will
have a standby line and overflow room at Rackham on the day of the event.
After we service our ticket holders when doors open at 6 p.m., we will begin to
let in those in the standby line.

If you are near the front of that line, you have a good chance at getting in. We
encourage you to line up on the WEST side of Rackham (the side closest to
North Quad) before the doors open on Tuesday.

Be prepared to go through metal detectors if you get in. No bags will be allowed
in Rackham, so please leave them at home or in your car.

Please email us at yafatumich@ gmail.com f you have ant questions. We hope

to see you Tuesday!

Exam 2 Grievances Gass

During Wednesday's class, Dr. Hahn said that “writing a test is an art.” If writing a test is an art, this past test was a finger
painting done by a 4 year old.

 

 

‘You have said that you truly care about the students in your class, you are well compensated monetarily, and you can't
spend 30 minutes to take the test yourself to make sure it is possible to do? Or at least ask a GSI to take the test? How do
you make a test where 2 problems were literally impossible to solve and 2 different problems you decided to give full credit
‘on. That is a grand total of 25/135 points that came from questions that did not come out as expected for you “artists.” You
didn’t even give full credit for the impossible questions! How does that make sense? Half the class spent a third of their time
trying to figure those questions out and might have just scribbled something at the last second just so it wasn't blank. There
is no telling how the writing of two impossible questions affects the entire test and our ability to have time to spend on each
question. Simply put, this was an illegitimate test and very unprofessional.

It you go home at night and tell your loved ones that you're a fair teacher that cares about the well being of their students,
just know that when you say that, you are looking directly into their eyes and lying,

| realize the tone of this message may be disrespectful, but that test was equally as disrespectful to us students, and I don't
feel bad about it,

‘Thanks for the halfwaytobest, that made me feel great. Looking forward to the next exam!
Best,

Advice on avoiding long functions
Hi, | wrote ~70 lines of main function in api.cpp, any advice on how to cut them down?

the students' answer, where students collectively construct single answer

Click to start off the wiki answer

(BD) the instructors’ answer, where insructorscofecively construct single answer

Ifyou have a large amount of code in your main() function in api.cpp, there are a few strategies you can use to simplify and organize your code:
1. Break up your code into smaller functions: If you have a large block of code that performs a specific task, consider refactoring it into a separate function. This will make your code more modular and easier to read.
2. Use helper functions: If you have a common pattem of code that you use in multiple places, consider creating a helper function that encapsulates that pattern. This will help reduce duplication and make your code more concise
3. Use data structures to organize your code: If you have a lot of related data and operations, consider creating a data structure to represent that data and encapsulate the related operations. This can help simplify your code and make it more modular.

 

‘Overall, the key to reducing the amount of code in your main() function is to break it up into smaller, more manageable chunks and to use control structures and data structures to simplify your code.

Hello all,

The second MWrite assignment is cancelled and will be removed from the syllabus.
As course coordinator | take complete responsibilty for the assignment and apologize
{for the offense that it caused. The goal of the assignment was to showcase the current
research of scholars from different backgrounds. However, equivocating
representation of resonance to representation in science is offensive. As it was being
developed we shared the assignment with a variety of people, including students and
faculty as our goal was to shift the traditional presentation of organic chemistry to
‘something more inclusive. However, this assignment not only failed to meet that goal,
it had the reverse effect. Thank you to those students who contacted me directly to
share their concern about the assignment.

My team will work to learn from this experience. We can and will do better. Again, my
sincere apologies to you.

Kind regards,

We want to alert you to an exciting change in
your financial aid. To help with your
educational costs, you will be receiving a one-
time U-M Supplemental Grant Award. In most
cases, we will be able to use this one-time
grant funding to reduce your borrowing for the
year. We anticipate payment to replace fall
and winter borrowing in the next week.

You may now view the additional funding
online in your Financial Aid Award Summary
for 2022-2023. You will receive a system-
generated email in the next week when the
PDF version, the Revised Financial Aid
Notice, is also available to view/print.

As a reminder, the financial aid team is
available to discuss any financial hardships or
special circumstances with you that may
impact your resources now or in the future.
Please reach out to our team if you have any
questions.

Please consider

That exam was absolutely ridiculous. There is no way anyone can finish either part comfortably in 40 minutes, forget ""having time to take screenshots of the exam"". The exam was harder than any past paper I've done, and we had 40 minutes less to do it. How is
that fair in any possible stretch of the imagination? It would be a crime to have a 85 or anything higher be an Ain this class, considering the pandemic, the lower time for the final, the fact that it was much harder than most past papers, and just the multitude of
problems that haven't been addressed from day one. We were told that this exam would be easier because Exam 2 was relatively tough, but this was even worse.

   

 

| don't expect anything by writing this because | can't remember the last time a complaint or issue was acknowledged or acted upon. | hope that at least at the end of the class there will be a change, and our final grades will consider the immense stress and mental
trauma we had to go through to complete this class this semester.

What is happening in
China?

* People gather to mourn the 10 lives lost in the
Urumdi Fire, due to extreme “covid” measures

+ Protests and resistance against in-humane
“lockdown” breaking out in multiple big cities across
China

+ Not even mourning is allowed, the Chinese
government is censoring all info and arresting
supporters.

* Crowds in China are holding up blank pages in
protest. If nothing is allowed to be said, then saying

nothing is saying everything

 

What can I do?

* Spread the word: Tell your friends, tell your family,
be our voice. Please feel free to copy and distribute
this pamphlet. Spread awareness about the ugly
truth that currently exists in China.

* Stand with us: Join the gathering, show allyship, ask
questions, express your support, we appreciate it.

+ Stop rumours: Don't buy into CCP’s propaganda
machine. Speak up and stop the spread of
misinformation

China Protest 101

Why are
Chinese people

gathering
here?

 

We stand here today ...

* To mourn those lost in the Urumai Fire, and the
many other lives taken by the extreme “covid policy”

* To stand with the brave people resisting and fighting
in China

* To be the voice for those who can't speak freely in
China

* To resist oppression by the Chinese Communist
government

* To fight for freedom and human rights for people

in China
  
 The Trigger: Urumgi Fire

* On Nov 24, 2022, people were trapped by “covid barricades” ina
high-rise building fire in Urumgi, Xinjiang. 10+ people burned alive.

+ Across the country, the Chinese government welds iron sheets,
fences, bars, wires to block residential building exits, to “prevent
spread of covid”

* The barricades exist for months, imprisoning millions of people in

many big cities.

  

(Wires and nails blocking doors of resident's apartments)

China’s “Zero-Covid”
policy IS NOT about Covid

+ “Zero-Covid"" is just an excuse for the Chinese Communist

government to take away people's rights and profit from it.

The “zero-covid” measures even spread covid, as the mandatory
testings requires thousands of people to gather at testing locations
everyday.

+ Extreme measures kill people through fire-hazards, starvation,

denying medical care for chronic patients, etc.

People who disagree are silenced, threatened with their job and

safety of faimily, even secretly arrested and “disappeared”.

Individuals are forced to pay for the PCR tests, with millions of tests
conducted per day. There is a huge profit chain for government-

owned medical companies.

 

 

Living under so-called
“Covid measures”

Although the rest of the world has returned to normalcy, Chinese
people continue to suffer through increasingly strict measures for
nearly all of 2022. Billions of people are affected in hundreds of cities.
* You are forced to pay for and take PCR tests everyday, even if
you are without any covid-like symptoms.
+ Awhole building's residents (200+ people) including infants,
pregnant mothers, seniors, even the physically handicapped can be

forced to leave their homes and live in warehouses.

 

The Chinese Communist Government tracks your every

movement. You can't go anywhere, not even the hospital,
supermarket, school, or work if you don't have the “health QR code”
on your phone.

* Residential buildings use iron sheets, bars, and walls to imprison

people and prevent them from leaving.

Chronic disease patients and seniors are unable to receive
treatment or medication because they are locked in; many have

died as a result.

Recent resistance
in China

+ Sitong bridge: Peng ZaiZhou protested by hanging a
banner on Sitong Bridge, in the heart of Beijing, where
political police are most extreme. His slogan is wide-

spread.

Chongqing Superman: an individual with a Superman
backpack gave a speech to the crowd against the CCP’s
forced quarantines, he was saved by the crowd when
police came to arrest him.

* Foxconn workers: Thousands of workers at the world’s
largest iPhone assembly plant broke through covid
barricades, protest againt being forced to work without

proper compensation

* Urumgi: (11/26-11/27) Following the deaths of nearly a
dozen people who were burned alive, thousands of
citizens goes on the street to protest againt human rights

abuses and demand an end to Covid restrictions.

Shanghai Urumgi Road: Hundreds of individuals gather
to express their frustrations about forced quarantines
and deaths that happened in Urumqi. Many protesters

were brutally arrested or went missing.

Beijing: Groups totalling over a 1,000 individuals gather

to demand easing of COVID restrictions.

Protests in many major cities: Guangzhou, Wuhan,
Zhengzhou, Chongging, etc. Residents break lockdown

barricades and go on street

100+ Univeristies in China: Students stand up to voice

their dissatisfaction
 Laziness and cowardice are the causes (Ursachen), why such a large
part of humanity, after nature has released them from external guidance
(natura liter maiorennes) [Latin translated: come of age via nature],
remain; but like life immaturity, and why it is so easy to set themselves up
as their guardians. It is so convenient to be immature. I have a book, which

 

understands for me, a pastor who has conscience (Gewissen) for me, and a
physician who decides my diet, etc., so I do not even need to try. Ido not
think, if only I can pay: others will readily undertake the irksome work for
me. That by far the largest proportion of people (including the entire
(ganze) fair sex), the step to maturity, but this is that it difficult, even for

 

very dangerous to think, have rendered those guardians, the ultimate
supervisor (Oberaufsicht) of them graciously took upon themselves. Once
they have made their domestic cattle first stupid and have made sure that
were these placid creatures will not dare step without the harness is it a like

it shows them the danger to them threatens. Now this danger is not so
great, for they would learn to walk by falling a few steps times, but an
example of this kind makes men timid and usually frightens them out of all
further attempts.

manage their ongoing research and

During spring break, the University
Health Service on the Ann Arbor campus
implemented changes to manage traffic
through the building and maintain an
environment as safe as possible. This
work frees up additional capacity to see
patients needing treatment for
respiratory symptoms.

Michigan Medicine is prepared to care
for patients diagnosed with COVID-19,
putting protections in place for patients
and employees. They have activated our
emergency response protocols,
proactively ordered supplies and
initiated plans for handling potential
patients.
 « We are canceling all U-M events and
events organized by others on our
campuses that would convene 100

12 until at least April 21.

This cancellation includes Honors
Convocation on March 15. Organizers of
other large events may seek to conduct
their event virtually. We ask organizers
to inform their audiences and
participants of changes as soon as
possible. The university will endeavor to
reschedule any affected third-party
events as practical. Individual units may
change smaller events at their discretion,
and all may consider virtual options.

Michigan Athletics is working to limit
spectators at its on-campus competitions
to parents and media to avoid high-

CoC yatsigya- Leet (salem (om auoene tt
students to limit large social gatherings.

We are continuing to monitor the impact
of the virus and will provide updates on
major end-of-semester events, including
commencements, when more
information is available.
 We ask managers and supervisors to continue
to encourage employees who are sick to stay
home from work. Additional precautions are
in place in Michigan Medicine to protect
employees from risks associated with caring
for patients. All U-M employees who may be at
greater risk should contact human resources
in their school, college or unit or Staff Human
Resources Services.

Steps to promote a healthy community

There are everyday actions to help prevent the
spread of all respiratory viruses:

« Stay home when you are sick.

« Wash your hands often with soap and
water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and
water are not available, use an alcohol-
based hand sanitizer.

« Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and
mouth with unwashed hands.

« Avoid close contact with people who are

¢ Consider alternatives to shaking hands.

and fever, it is not advised to wear a

 We are also canceling U-M education
abroad programs scheduled for the
spring semester, and will decide about
programs that start July 1 or thereafter
in the coming weeks when we have
better information. This follows

recommendations from health and safety
professionals working on all three of our
campuses and at Michigan Medicine. Their
work has been ongoing for several weeks in
close coordination with public health officials
at the federal, state and local levels, along with
other universities.

Last night, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced
that there are two presumptive positive cases
of COVID-19 in the state of Michigan, one of
whom is being treated at Michigan Medicine.
We fully agree with her in urging everyone to
follow public health guidelines listed below for

Additionally, our COVID-19 information page
has specific guidance developed by our health
professionals for individuals who have
traveled to areas affected by the virus. That
information is available here.
 Most university operations will remain
unchanged, with four exceptions that take
effect Thursday, March 12, for all three of our
campuses:

the last day of classes this semester.

Faculty and instructors should let
students know how this transition will be
handled for each of their classes. The two
days of cancellations give faculty time to
transition to alternative formats. The
provost’s offices on each of our campuses
SUE NUcMolematclenate-veecbouMwlmOLely
schools and colleges to facilitate these
transitions.
 « We have created a Remote Resources
Guide to assist students, faculty and staff
with working or engaging remotely, and
the Ann Arbor Provost’s Office has
additional information on remote
instruction.

We have heard concerns from members
of our community who have chronic
health conditions, and will work to assist
with accommodations for classes or work
arrangements. Students needing
additional assistance should contact the
Dean of Students office, and employees
should contact their unit supervisor.

We thank the many students, faculty and staff
who have been working with us during the
COVID-19 outbreak. We know there are many
questions and concerns as the situation
continues to change rapidly and will continue
to post the latest information to our COVID-19
information page. The page also includes
frequently asked questions, definitions of key
terms, and additional resources and
information for the U-M community.

Viruses like COVID-19 affect all of us, and we
appreciate everyone’s efforts to support one
another, promote a healthy community, and
stay up to date on the latest information from
our health professionals.

To All Members of the U-M Community:

University of Michigan health professionals
have been closely monitoring the spread of
COVID-19 over the past two months.

Our goals are to deliver on our mission while
protecting health and safety by minimizing the
potential spread of the disease, both within
our community and in the broader society. The
changes we are announcing today follow the
general public health principle of limiting the
interaction of people within larger groups to
diminish disease transmission and protect
everyone in our communities, particularly the
most vulnerable.

Today, we are announcing new universitywide
measures based on public health principles
and the latest information and assessments for
our community.

We will also continue to post all updates to our
COVID-19 information page, as we monitor this
rapidly changing situation in real time.
 We are suspending all U-M
international travel until at least April
21, with rare exceptions requiring
approval. Domestic travel for
university business is strongly
discouraged.

Rare exceptions for international travel
deemed essential may be granted if
approved by a designated administrator.
We encourage domestic travelers to seek
virtual methods of convening for
university business. The university also
discourages personal domestic and

COVID-19 is becoming frequent in many
places, and we want to be sure our
students can get medical care that meets
their needs, as more countries’ health
care systems are facing greater
pressure. Students in each education
abroad program will have unique needs
and considerations as we make plans to
bring them home. We are working
through those, including safety, location,
ability to travel, and disruption to
academic progress. We will work with
the students to assist them with
arrangements and academic
accommodations, including credit for

Due to an unfortunate
increase in theft recently, we
have decided to remove cups

from the Kiosk station.

If you ordered a drink as a Rapid Pick Up, you will find
a cup with your receipt on the Rapid Pick Up shelf. If
you ordered a meal with a drink on the Kiosk, we will
give you a cup when the rest of your order is handed to

you. If you would like to place an order for just a drink,

please consider placing it online, through the app, or just
with a team member at the register.

Thank you for your understanding though this transition.

In the heart of Ann Arbor, a school of fame
Founded in 1817, with a rich history
From the Law School to the Business, a name

That stands for excellence, in every industry

With top-ranked programs and research, we strive
To conquer the world, one day, with our pride
The Big House on game day, a sea of maize and blue

A victory for the home team, we hope, with a roar

From the Diag to the Arb, a campus alive
With a strong spirit and a vibrant community
Go Blue, Go Blue, we're proud to be Wolverines

A world-class education, for sure, with unity

In the heart of the Midwest, a Great Lake state

As you may have noticed, Chez Betty is looking a bit empty these days. We wanted to reach out and give you a bit of insight into why that is the case, and
ask for your help in rectifying the issue.

Originally stock levels lowered due to the primary Betty volunteers being too busy with research deadlines to make a Costco run, but these new lows are
more due to a drastic increase in user debt and theft over the last couple of months. In January and February 2020 alone, Betty experienced
unprecedented debt and theft levels---for the first time since reopening, the combination of debt and theft resulted in a net operating loss.

Theft is an ongoing issue, but as we don't have 24/7 cashiers in our automated model, we rely on customer integrity. If you see theft occur, please speak
up---with theft at the current rates, our 20% markup is not sufficient to cover operating costs.

While we have a standard markup to account for theft, it was never planned to handle both debt and theft of these levels simultaneously; we therefore must
take action to see at least one of these addressed before we can continue operations. In light of this, we have paused all Costco runs and reduced
frequency of any Amazon shipments until we see user debt go below $2,000. If you know individuals who have negative Betty balances, please encourage
them to pay their debts---until they do, Betty will operate with minimal restocks.

Thank you for your ongoing help,

5385,"Important update to CSE from the
Dean

1am writing today to share the news that CSE professor Peter Chen has been
placed on administrative leave because of pending criminal sexual conduct
charges. His teaching and other duties are being reassigned

There is no indication that this criminal charge is connected to his teaching or
research at the University of Michigan. Nonetheless, | realize this information
will be shocking to many of you, and comes after several semesters of reports
of climate-related issues in the CSE division.

Let me be clear ~ sexual misconduct is completely unacceptable in any form. 1
encourage anyone who has any information about misconduct to report it. tis
only when we are aware of issues that we can address them. Please report any
sexual and gender-based misconduct, discrimination or harassment to the
Office of institutional Equity, and any information regarding criminal activities to
DPSS or local police.

| want to make sure you have the support you may need. Please know that the
Engineering CARE Center is always available to help you, and the University’s
Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) has counselors available for all
UM students.

Finally, | want to personally acknowledge that the continued allegations of
misconduct involving CSE faculty are troubling. | plan to work side-by-side with
Chair Michael Wellman and others within the College and University to continue
addressing the culture and climate, and ensure we are doing everything in our
power to provide a safe and welcoming environment for our students, faculty,
staff and postdocs.

faith in time & “looking around"" texts.

{3 MY SISTER ADRIANA DAVIDSON IS MISSING §
Missing Duration: 24+ hrs

Age: 15

Area: Pioneer High School Ann Arbor, MI

The sheriffs department is involved & her friends and their
parents have been looking around. Her phone was “found
at the tennis court” at Pioneer High by someone who then
returned it to her friend. Adriana has been missing for more
than 24 hours & we just need her home. A student told her
best friend that they saw her at the bus stop with a man in
a black sweatshirt & black pants & “they didn’t seem like
they knew each other” but who knows.. & | spoke with
her friend as someone who has been the one who has
covered for a friend before like we all have... | can tell she’s
telling me the truth & is just as worried; which is why I'm
now making this public.

Please just say a prayer for Adriana, her safety, and our
family. | beg that she's “just being a teenager” but no
teenager leaves their phone behind in 2023.

Last Post to Request a Capacity Increase for Waitlisted Students

Dunno if we are allowed to post this here, but this might be our last chance to do so. Please if you have a chance, take a look at our report here, which provides a comprehensive analysis based
on facts and data on the resource availability for EECS 482 to support additional students.

This is the second year students had similar demands. In the previous year (WN 22) when the course had the same capacity limit of 240 students, Professor Kapritsos argued that larger sections
decrease instructors’ ability to engage with students, increasing load and stress levels for staff. Thus what we are facing is a tradeoff between the quality of teaching, and access to learning. While
there is no right or wrong choice between either inclination, as is with many other difficult tradeoffs, we do believe that the decision should not be lightly made, and has to be made within context
under the guidance of our values. In this case, we argue that the University of Michigan, as a premier public institution funded by the people and the government, with a mission to expand access
to knowledge, shall value the total utility of more students having the opportunity to engage with the material to be greater than fewer students receiving higher quality of education. Moreover, our
dedication to promoting diversity, equity and inclusion, in conjunction with CSE’s mission to “empower every individual to reach their full potential”, suggests that the decision to expand access to
education and course capacity aligns with our values, and will benefit our community as a whole.

The more exclusive, restricted access to certain resources someone has, the more it fuels the illusion of a competitive advantage. This is what that leads to a cutthroat, competitive culture. It is
completely normal for anyone to feel this way, no moral judgements here, as this is a part of our human nature that helps us survive in a cruel world where resources are so constrained. However
the building of a community is where people overcome their ugly side of human nature, such as bias and prejudice, selfishness and indifference, so that we could find common interests, improve
our culture, and proceed to make progress. Not to mention that in our case, there IS sufficient resource that would allow more members of the community to thrive. Locking people away from it

only intensifies the competition and does further damage to our culture.

If you are personally affected by the situation, or think our demands are reasonable, feel free to sign the petition here. We’ve submitted the report to CSE DEI Chair Prof. Weimer, and he personally
recommended us doing so, so that CSE administration could better understand student demand.

Thank you and everyone who have poured their effort into this course.

1. Don't step on the M!

 

The most iconic spot on campus comes with the
most widely known myth. At the center of the Diag
is a brass block M, donated by the class of 1953.
Campus legend says that if you step on the block M,
you will fail your first blue book exam.

You will never ever see a Michigan student step
on the M. Many students still refuse to step on it
even after they ve taken a blue book exam out of a
mixture of respect and fear of the M.

One of the most amazing parts and one of my
favorite things about coming to a school like the
University of Michigan is that it's a place built on
tradition. They're traditions that | love to partake

in as a student, ones | know that I'll cherish as an
alumnus, and memories that | know |'I| keep with me
for a long, long time.

Update on verdict in trial of CSE Professor Peter Chen tnbox x a @

Michael Wellman <wellman@umich.edu> 4:59 PM (17 minutesago) ye :

to cse-fac, cse-phd-students, cse-staff, cse-postdocs, cse-ms-students, EECS, EECS, ce-undergrads, cse-undergrads ~

CSE Community —
Professor Peter Chen was acquitted today, 5 Dec 2022, in Washtenaw County Circuit Court. The acquittal was reached by a jury who heard all of the witnesses and other evidence. We respect the process and decision of the jury.
There are currently no charges pending against Professor Chen. He has been on administrative leave since January of 2021 and will remain on leave while we review the current situation.

The uncertainty since Chen’s arrest has been a strain on many in our community. Please be understanding with each other, and respect that everyone will process this news differently. Do not be afraid to seek help if you need it. Faculty and staff may contact the Faculty and Staff Counseling and Consultation Office (FASCCO), and students may reach

out to Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS).

Good morning, my name is
Jesus Gonzalez. I'm reaching
out to Umich students with
information about the Army
Reserve. You will study full time
while having college paid, loan
repayment and a job of your
choosing. You will stay in
Michigan and the only time you
get to be in the Army is a
weekend a month. Let me know
if you're interested, have a good
day!

Dear Residents,

 

We are following up on the email sent last night from the Interim Vice President of
‘Student Life. New developments in the COVID-19 pandemic make it clear that now is
the time to return home. Per orders from Governor Gretchen Whitmer, services such
as libraries, gym and recreation facilities, and large gathering spaces are shutting
down. Dining halls will now only serve boxed to-go meals, and students on-campus
should expect dining and residence halls to consolidate

‘Students who wish to remain in University Housing will need to first have their request
approved, using the form below.

Note:

* While University Housing will ensure that we have sufficient housing available
for students who truly have no other alternatives, we cannot promise that you
will be able to remain in your current housing assignment. Apartments such
as Northwood |, Il Il, IV, V, Lawyers Club and Munger Graduate Residences
are exceptions.

* Ifyou are assigned a new housing assignment you will be expected to move
in order to remain eligible for housing,

To apply to remain on campus, submit the REQUEST TO REMAIN IN HOUSING form
and explain why you must remain on-campus during this time. This information is
needed by 8am on Wednesday, March 18th. If you do not respond we will assume you
have left campus and will discontinue building access

We thank you in advance for your prompt response,

just wanted to vent where people could see it- i missed literally ONE arrow on this question (i get that
the arrow should have been there; i just literally missed it on accident) and all my other arrows were

just too much for a one arrow mistake. please make it make sense thank you.

1735,"There have been many reports of mice/rats in the EECS building.
First, | want to assure EECS occupants, the EECS building does not
have rats. Rats are large, generally 3 to 4 inches tall and 6 to 8
inches long with a tail as long as their body. EECS building has had
an influx of mice which is common in the winter time as they seek
warm areas. The sightings have also increased significantly due to
the flood as many rooms were affected driving the mice to seek
new warm dry areas. In addition to the mice seeking warm dry
areas, mice are also drawn to food sources. To help reduce the
mice population, open food should not be kept in the office
(including candies, and dry foods). Any food in offices should be
kept in a refrigerator, in a metal tin or acrylic container, do not use
plastic such as tupperware or rubbermaid. Desk or file drawers are
not a safe alternative as they are able to get into these drawers
through the smallest crack (1/4 inch). You should also not eat in
your office, however, if you do, any waste receptacles containing
food products should be emptied into the trash receptacles in the
hallways at the end of one's shift. Please feel free to reachout to
me if you have any questions.

EVERYBODY GETS 100
All Sections

Hiall,

You should have received your grades and comments by now through Canvas. If not, let me know and |
will get them to you.

After much thought | have decided that circumstances this semester are just too dire to justify grading
as usual. | am giving every student the highest grade possible on every assignment, and | am calling on
other educators at U-M and nationwide to do the same. | am attaching a statement which explains my
decision. The TLDR is that if the U wants students to be given non-perfect grades, they will have to get
someone else to do it. | will not.

I hope you will take the time to read the statement I have attached. And if it resonates with you, please
feel free to share it with others. | don't know how the university will react to my decision or what will
happen as a result, but I can tell you that it will be a political struggle and that it will therefore depend
on what people decide to do--and one of those people is you.

I hope this brings you some relief in these trying times. And | hope you will still participate in this class
to the extent that you can while still taking care of yourself--that comes first. To be clear, my intention is
still to perform every other function that a GSI normally performs. Unless | am fired, | still intend to
hold classes and office hours, and give feedback on assignments--I just won't give any student any
grade other than 100.

Best wishes,
Jesse

angry/disgusted at her and make low blows. | insult features of her face one at a time so there is
nothing she could possibly still like. She's not actually ugly, | just know it hurts.

| also said :

her Ed is all her fault and she deserves it

her friends are pathetic

She's gay bc she has talked about liking girls online but never to me

mock her for “thinking she’s beautiful on the inside” even though she never said she does

| stalked her account on an eating disorder forum, mocked her for her personal posts, about her
sexuality etc.

She's nice to everyone except me and my dad, and would be nice to us if she wasn’t anorexic.

She twists things to seem like she has it worse than me in every aspect bc she’s jealous of me
and how I've always been skinny/average without trying and she was chubbier as a kid.

She lies about her social life to make it seem sad and tries to convince me I'm “likeable” and
“popular”.

My mom died when | was 11 and | don’t feel anything when | think of her anymore bc of my
sister. My sister and her were closer than | was to her and she completely denies this fact, and
has managed to make me kind of hate my mom by mocking me for being “like her” which | am
not, she and my mom bonded over things they had in common. When | think about her now |
just think of her in a completely negative way bc my sister uses being “like her” as an insult.
When | give evidence that my mom and her were closer she shuts down my argument bc | got
all the money. I’m the oldest child but | honestly was surprised too. My sister told me and my
dad about many things that my mom told her about her life that | didn't even have a clue about.

When | was in middle school | had a diary to vent about my ocd. She read it and accused me of
“trying to convey a message”, her pretentious way of saying “faking it for attention”.

She's controlling, gives me no privacy, and justifies it bc | don't share everything with her.

She mocks me for being Christian and says I'm trying to hide it from her to be “better than” her.
| am not ready to share my faith with anyone esp her.

She accuses ME of having an Ed and even tried to turn my friend against me by sending her
dms calling me “a manipulative gaslighter who only cares about her eating disorder”. | told my
friends to block;she was abt to go after them too.

Her eating disorder makes her irrationally jealous of me and convinced my mom didn’t like her. |
see how she treats others;sweet, understanding, mature. When | treat her badly | get angrier
and treat others badly. | used to follow Ed accounts on my Instagram in freshman year to
understand her better, now | get angry at anyone with eating disorders bc they remind me of
her. | know my actions are wrong but | don’t feel bad for them. AITA bc she’s mentally ill and I’m
just vengeful and angry at her.
