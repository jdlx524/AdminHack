ALlcpg = {(G) | G isa CFG and L(G) = 5°}.

ALLceg is undecidable (you don't have to show this).

Use the undecidability of ALLerg to show that TRIVIALocpg is undecidable.(For example,
you can reduce ALLepg to TRIVIALcpg ). Use Sipser notation for your TM. Alternatively,
it is also acceptable to use the “box inside a box” visual description we used in class. For
either approach, you must clearly indicate that you are doing a proof by contradiction, and
at the conclusion of your argument indicate the contradiction you have reached.

Recall that you are allowed to use all results from the book and the notes. Please clearly

state what you are using. (In particular, recall that the acceptance problem for CFGs ( Acrc)
and the emptyness problem for CFGs (Eorg) are decidable .

Lab Work For the Database...

CPEN 102: Introduction to Database Systems

Lecturer: Mr. George Kodjo Anni

‘On successful completion of the laboratory work, student should be able to:
1. Appreciate the importance of conceptual modelling and apply the entity-relationship
‘modelling approach to a realistic scenario.
. Understand and apply the essential concepts of relational databases, (including keys
normalization and referential integrity) to sample data sets.
. Given a business scenario, demonstrate the ability to apply best practice in the development
of an appropriate and effective database system,
|. Identify and effectively apply appropriate activities involved in database administration.
. Appreciate the significance of security in relation to Database Management Systems.

COURSEWORK 1 [50 marks)

The Global Motos g School was established in a makeshift kiosk at Lapaz in 2007.
‘The School has since then grown steadily and now has several plush offices in most of the major
towns in Accra. The School is now so large that the communication and sharing of information
between offices is poor, hence more administrative staff are being employed to cope with the ever-
increasing amount of paperwork. The Director of the School, Dr. Kofi Nkansah, feels that too
many mistakes are being made and that the success of the Schoo! will be short-lived if nothing
done to remedy the situation. Understanding that a database could help in part solve the problem
of increased paperwork; he has approached you to draw up the logical design of his intended
database to support the running of the Global Motoring and Driving School

To help understand the workings of the school, Dr. Kofi Nkansah has provided you with the
following brief description of how the Global Motoring and Driving School operates.

Each office has a Manager [who tends to also be a Senior Instructor]. several Senior
Instructors, Instructors, and administrative staff. The Manager is responsible for the day-
to-day running of the office. Clients must first register at an office and this requires that
they complete an application form, which records their personal details. Before the first
lesson, a client is requested to attend an interview with an Instructor to assess the needs of
the client and to ensure that the client holds a valid provisional driving license. A client is
free to ask for a particular Instructor or to request that an Instructor to be changed at any
stage throughout the process of learning to drive. After the interview, the first lesson is
booked. A client may request individual lessons or book a block of lessons for a reduced
fee. An individual lesson is for one hour, which begins and ends at the office. A lesson is
with a particular Instructor in a particular car at a given time. Lessons can start as early

Page | 1

as 8am and as late as 6:30pm. After each lesson, the Instructor records the progress made
by the client and notes the mileage used during the lesson. The School has a pool of cars,
which are adapted for the purposes of teaching. Each Instructor is allocated 10 a
particular car. As well as teaching, the Instructors are free to use the cars for personal
use. The cars are inspected at regular intervals for faults. Once ready, a client applies
for a driving test date. To obtain a full driving license the client must pass both the

Cambridge Researchers Develop
Graphene-Based HDDs For 10x More
Storage

Researchers from Cambridge University have
found out that ultra-high density HDDs made
with graphene can store 10x more data when
compared to ""traditional"" hard drives.

 

The researchers replaced a HDD's carbon
based overcoats (COCs) with graphene, which
has enable the data density of HDDs to grow
ten-fold. It also reduced friction and provided
better corrosion and wear than most solutions.

Idea for work

Job sets up the scheduling for jobs on the
assembly line people will work each day. It's
often criticized for being repetitive or
annoying because people have to double
down (work the same job more than once a
night)

Goal:

1. create a program that will randomly reroll
people into jobs every night. Based on
whether or not they can run a job. During the
four qaurters they work.

2. Program will only double up if absolutely
neccessary or will leave a spot blank. For
process supporters (schedule makers to
choose who has to double up)

3. program will have a back up option for
people who're still training to be easily placed
manually in a job with someone else (or
automatically)

Minor needs:

1 User friendly able. Makes it so process
supporters can edit the schedule should the
need arise

2. User friendly ability for coworkers to read.
Think Microsoft excel formmating.

3.ability to toggle between two shifts.

Data mining fields focus on prediction as
compared to generating exact results for
future purposes.

e Identification

Identification allows us to identify the data
pattern in the existing item.

void sthread_create(thread, func, arg)
Create a new thread, storing information about it in thread. The thread
will execute the function func, which will be called with the argument arg.

void sthread_yield()
The calling thread voluntarily gives up the processor to let some other
thread(s) run. The scheduler can resume running the calling thread when-
ever it chooses to do so.

int sthread_join(thread)

Wait for the specified thread thread to finish if it has not already done so;
then return the value passed to sthread_exit() by the specified thread
thread. Note that sthread_join() may be called only once for each
thread.

void sthread_exit (ret)
Finish the current thread. Store the the value ret in the current thread’s
data structure and, if another thread is already waiting in a call to
sthread_join(), then wake it up so that it can run and return this value.

Create a program that converts the binary data from the file into plain text

Read the text file provided.

Create at least two functions — one to read the binary data and convert it to decimal

and the other to convert the decimal value into its ASCII character equivalent.

The first function must return a result value, this result will be passed on to the
second function as an input parameter.

2% Note that the data is stored in bytes, you need to dissect the binary in the right

length.

Using of built-in functions for conversion is not allowed.

Print the plaintext via console. What does it say?

proposed by Backus and friends, and again was op-
posed by almost all programmers. First, it was said
it could not be done. Second, if it could be done, it
would be too wasteful of machine time and cap-
acity. Third, even if it did work, norespectable pro-
grammer would use it—it was only for sissies!

The use of FORTRAN, like the earlier symbolic
programming, was very slow to be taken up by
the professionals. And this is typical of almost all
professional groups. Doctors clearly do not follow
the advice they give to others, and they also have
 Finally, a more complete, and more useful, Symbolic
Assembly Program (SAP) was devised—after more
years than you are apt to believe, during which
time most programmers continued their heroic ab-
solute binary programming. At the time SAP first
appeared I would guess about 1% of the older pro-
grammers were interested in it—using SAP was
‘sissy stuff,” and a real programmer would not
stoop to wasting machine capacity to do the as-
sembly. Yes! Programmers wanted no part of it,

A microprocessor is clocked at a rate of 20 GHz.

1. How long is a clock cycle?
1 Hz is equal to 1 cps, then 20Ghz = 20,000,000,000Hz = 20 000 000 000cps.

To get the duration of a clock cycle, you have to calculate the period which is simply ‘frequency or ‘/ops.

1 / (20,000,000,000) = 0.05 nanoseconds

 

2. What is the duration of a particular type of mac!
of six clock cycles?

IF clock cycle is 0.05 nanoseconds;

 

then 6 clock cycles are:

0.05 * 3 = 0.15 nanoseconds

5278,"The etymology of computing terms

ee oe

Avatar

The word avatar, a graphical representation of
a person in a computer game or internet forum,
comes from Hindu mythology where it refers to
a deity descending to earth in human form. It
was first used in the computing sense from the
1980s. The word comes from the Sanskrit
avatara meaning ‘descent’.

Boot

Boot, meaning to start a computer, is short for
‘bootstrap routine’ and comes from the phrase
‘to pull yourself up by your bootstraps’ meaning
to succeed through your own efforts. The saying
was inspired by the 1785 book The Adventures
of Baron Munchausen, in which the protagonist
tells a series of tall tales including pulling himself
out of a swamp by his own hair.

Bu

Bug, mearing an error ina computer program or
system, was used to refer to mechanical errors
from the late 1800s. American inventor Thomas
Edison, who helped popularise the term, wrote in
1889 that a bug was “an expression for solving
a difficulty and implying that some imaginary
insect has secreted itself inside and is causing all
the trouble”.

Cache

Cache, a temporary store of data that can be
retrieved and served quickly, was originally used
by French Canadian trappers as a term for a
hiding place to store goods or provisions from
the late 18th century. It derives from the Latin
coactare meaning ‘to constrain’ via the French
cacher meaning ‘to hide’.

Cloud

The cloud or cloud computing, meaning
computing software and services that run over
the internet, was a concept first coined at
computer company Compaq in 1996. It comes
from the convention of clouds typically be used
to denote a network or the internet in diagrams.

 

Cookie

The term cookie, a small packet of data, was
first used by Unix programmers in the 1970s,
possibly inspired by fortune cookies that contain
short prophecies. The “web cookie” was coined
by programmer Lou Montulli in 1994. The word
cookie comes from the Dutch koekje meaning
‘little cake’ and was brought to America by
Dutch colonists in the 1600s.

Daemon

The word daemon, a program that runs in the
background on Unix systems, was coined by
programmers at MIT in the 1960s. It was
inspired by Maxwell's Demon, a 19th-century
thought experiment in which a demon controls a
flow of gas molecules, and also Greek mythology
where a demon is an intermediary between men
and Gods rather than an evil figure.

 

Default
Default, the preselected option in a computer
program or software, was borrowed from the +

French defaute, ‘a failure to do something’ or an
errenceloneatenminerenntasitonted initia ~
computing sense from the mid-1960s for

options or settings selected by a program when
a user fails to specify one.

~e

 

Domain

The word domain, a subnetwork or unit of a
larger network, comes from the Latin dominicum
via the French demaine meaning ‘belonging to a
lord’. Domain started to be used in the
computing sense from around 1978, while
domain name, an identifying string in a network
address, first appeared in 1985.

Ethernet

The word ethernet, the traditional method for
connecting devices in a wired network, is a blend
of the words ether (the upper regions of space
beyond the clouds) and net (as in ‘network’). It
was coined by Dr Robert Metcalfe who named it
after ‘luminiferous ether’, the medium that 19th
century scientists believed carried light waves.

W) @thestrangeroots

Log

Log or log file, a file that records events that
occurs while a system or program runs, stems
from the ship's log, a piece of wood and length
of rope that was used to measure the speed of
a ship from the 16th century. The nautical log
also gave us the logbook, the verb to log, the
act of logging in and the noun login.

Patch

The term patch, a small piece of code that fixes
a fault or improves a program, comes from the
1940s when programmers would fix issues by
sticking physical patches of tape over the holes
in the punch cards used to program the early
computers. Patch possibly comes from a variant
of the Middle French piece meaning ‘piece’.

Spam

Spam, meaning unsolicited emails or postings,
was inspired by a Monty Python sketch about a
cafe with a SPAM-filled menu and a chorus of
vikings singing about SPAM. It was first used to
refer to junk email and unsolicited forum
postings in 1993. The tinned meat product's
name is a portmanteau of spiced and ham.

Wiki

The word wiki, a user-editable website, comes
from the Hawaiian word meaning ‘quick’. Ward
Cunningham, the creator of the first wiki - the
WikiWikiWeb, said the name was inspired by a
trip to Honolulu where he took the Wiki Wiki
shuttle bus service from the aiport and learned
it meant ‘very quick’ in Hawaiian.

Zip

Zip, the archive file format that supports
lossless data compression, was created in 1989
and named PKZIP after its creator Phil Kratz. The
name zip was suggested by his friend Robert
Mahoney because it meant ‘moving at high
speed’ and it implied that it was faster than
other available compression formats at the time.

The result was too large of a number to be stored in floating-point representation.

Explanation

 

 

Returns a substring of consecutive characters of str starting with the character at
position Start and ending with the character at position end. The first character of
Str is considered position 1. For example, substring(""delivery"", 32, 6)
retums ""live™.

substring(str, start, end)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

eoncat(stri, str2) Retums a single string consisting of stri followed by str2 For example,

concat( ""key"", ""board"" ) returns ""keyboard"".

 

Returns the number of characters in str. For example, len{ ""key"" ) returns 3

Instructions

In this assignment, you will write a program that will process data in thejokes.ixt and answers:txt files. Set up your program so that it will do the following

tasks:

1. Displays the number of jokes in jokes. txt
2. Asks the user for the number of a joke
3. Displays the joke

4, Displays the requested joke

5. Displays the requested answer

Use the | answers_filepath and | jokes_filepath variables to open the files and solve this problem.

Sample Run

There are 10 jokes
Which joke do you want to see? 7

Joke #7

She used steel wool!
 LHECK POUT LOUE
1. First, copy and paste the following code into the ""Solve"" tab in the Sandbox:
import os
# This program has read/write access to the WORKSPACE directory

Jokes_filepath = os.path.join( os.environ['WORKSPACE'], ‘Jokes.txt' )
answers_filepath = os.path.join( os.environ['WORKSPACE'], ‘answers.txt' )

 

# The testing system will let this program know how many lines to expect
nun_of_lines = int( input() )

# Copy input into the files. Do not modify!
with open( jokes_filepath, ‘w' ) as jokes_file:
with open( answers_filepath, ‘w' ) as answers_file:
for _ in range( nun_of_lines ):
fokes_file.write( input() + '\n' )
answers_file.write( input() + '\n' )

# lirite your program below

2. Then, copy and paste your program from Replit, starting at line 7, to the Sandbox, directly underneath the code you copied in step 1.

7522,"Q-4 [40 pts] This question may look familiar as it deals with Covid vaccination. However, it is much
easier this time as you can use iterations. Assume the following as of Feb 10:

¢ Population of the US = 330 million
e People already vaccinated = 40 million
e Vaccination rate is 1.5 million per day

The program takes one user input: A Daily Increase Rate (DIR) of vaccines. The number of people
vaccinated each day is DIR% higher than the previous day. For each day from Feb 10 to Feb 20,
the program should print the number of people vaccinated that day. The program should also print
the percentage of the population vaccinated at the end of this period on Feb 20. Sample Session
fe

Program Prompt: Enter the Percent Daily Increase Rate
User response: 0

Program prints/output:

On Feb 12 1.5 million were vaccinated
On Feb 11 1.5 million were vaccinated
On Feb 12 1.5 million were vaccinated
On Feb 13 1.5 million were vaccinated
On Feb 14 1.5 million were vaccinated
On Feb 15 1.5 million were vaccinated
On Feb 16 1.5 million were vaccinated
On Feb 17 1.5 million were vaccinated
On Feb 18 1.5 million were vaccinated
On Feb 19 1.5 million were vaccinated
On Feb 20 1.5 million were vaccinated

By Feb 20 17.12121212121212 % of the population is vaccinated

Sample session 2:

Program Prompt: Enter the Percent Daily Increase Rate
User response: 40

Program prints/output:

On Feb 12 1.5 million were vaccinated
On Feb 11 2.1 million were vaccinated
On Feb 12 2.94 million were vaccinated

On Feb 14 5.7624 million were vaccinated

MACHINES

What is SVM?

‘Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is o
supervised machine learning algorithm
which can be used for both classification
or regression. However, its mostly used
in classification problems.

In this algorithrs, we plot each date item
{8 6 point in n-dimensional space (where
nis the number of features) with the
value of each feature being the value of
1 particular coordinate.

SUPPORT VECTOR

In2D, the best hyper-plane is

How is the data classified?

We perform classification by finding the
hyperplane that differentiates the two
losses very well. In other words the
algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane
which categorizes new examples.

What is a optimal Hyper-Plane?

For SYM, it's the one that moximizes the
‘margins from both tags. In other words:
the hyperplane whose distance to the
nearest element of each tag is the largest.

 

Not all hyper-planes are

TUNING PARAMETERS

KERNEL

The learning of the hyperplane in lingor SYM is
dono by trosforming tho problom using some naar
algebra. This is where the kernel plays role.
‘Polynomial and exponential kernels calculates
‘separation line in higher dimension, This is called

GAMMA

‘The gamma parameter defines how for the
influence of a single training set reachos. With low
_gomme, points far way from the possible
“separation line are considered in caleuation for the
seporation line. Where as high gamma means the
points close to possible line are considered in

Our Laravel Vs Django:
Detailed Differences

let’s see the detailed differences between Django and Laravel and decide
which of Django vs Laravel is the best fit for you:

Performance Community

Django is a Python web Both Laravel and Django have
development framework. very responsive and_ active
heading communities.

Security
Web applications are more
vulnerable to security So, in terms of API support,
attacks than desktop Laravel is the clear winner of
applications Laravel vs Django.

API Support

 

Database Support

A database is very important
for efficiently storing and
retrieving important

application files.

It’s not often anyone has the
opportunity to see miracles occur
before their eyes. But I still
remember the first tine I saw
VisiCalc in operation. VisiCalc is
one of many software packages that
fall into the “electronic
spreadsheet"" classification. Water
into wine has nothing on these aids
to businessnen.

Electronic spreadsheets are the
backbone of the next revolution in
business, and fortunately it’s the
first revolution open to both the
small and big businessperson.

The concept behind such a
spreadsheet is really quite simple.
With all of these prograns, i.e.
VisiCalc, Supercalc, Lalcstar, etc.,
you sinpl put the software ( progran)
disk in the disk drive, turn on the
machine and watch a large accounting
spreadsheet appear on your wonitor.

With all prograns, the
spreadsheet size exceeds the size of
the screen by a factor of about ten.
These spreadsheets are humungus. The
spreadsheet consists of rows and
columns. These rows and coluwns are
each labeled. Usually the rows are
nunbered and the columns are
lettered. A sample is below:

A 8&8 ¢€ DE

eng rs

As a result you have a large
nuaber of individual ""cells"", each
with an address. For example, the
address of the top lefthand spot
would be Al.

The programs put all sorts of
calculation and logic power into each
cell. You can put a value into a
cell, making cell A2 equal to 1 and
A3 equal to 2. The one and two are
the values. “

At A4, you could put a formula.
For instance, if could ask for the
SUM of A2 and Ag. You wouldn’t see
the formula: you would see the
result. That is, in cell A4 would
Fuge? the nuneral 3, or the SUM of
the values of A2 and Ad.

A small business, on the other
hand, could use the processing power
of a microcomputer. King stresses
that the equipment type and financial
ability of the client must match.

3. What is their attitude toward
computers in general? ""I’ve cone up

is ecstatic about computers, and the
other doesn’t want anything to do

Volume i,

what is
a computer?

. Following is ;
probably the country’s
most important
question, and our
attempt at an answer.

WHAT IS A COMPUTER?
It’s an appliance
that strings numbers
together according to
whatever program (set
of instructions) it’s
eperating on.
isn’t a god-in-a-box.
You aren’t required to
understand some fancy
computer language te
make it operate, any
more than you need to
build an engine every
time you want to drive
to work.
Let’s continue
with our automotive
analogy. The computer
is the car; the
program is the road map
CUnpecscod- or Sabo ve
paper, esch with one
instruction that must
be foelicwed to the
letter. The program
tells the computer
what to do, and how to
do it exactly in order.
You, however,
decide where you want
to geo steer around
pot oles on the way,
and do what you want
when you get there.
ere’sS an example
of a pea a you only
live a block from your
ob and there is no
raffic or stoplights.
As a result, your map
beeets are simple.
hey would be
like:
slip:

Second slip: Back
out of garage.
hird slip: Go
south on the street.

Fourth slip: Drive
one block at 30 miles
per hour.

Fifth slip: Slow

down when you approach
your building.
; Sixth slip? Park
in front of your place
of employment. |

_ Seventh slip:
Write a note to
yourself saying ""I’m.
at work"", and put it
in your pocket.

Tf the above was 2
program, it would have
seven program numbers,
and result in a slip
of paper saying “I’m
at work"".

To get home in the
evening, you’d need a
second program taking
most of the above
steps in reverse, and
end in a note saying
""I’m at home"".

Should you have a
job on the other side
Of town, your slips cf
paper would be more
numerous, and your
trip correspondingly

THE FLAY

The ""Twin Cities Computer User""
is a nonthly survey, in simple ;
English, of the personal computer in
the home, in business, and in the
professions. —

We will look at the electrical
and wechanical equipment (known as
hardware), and the instructions that
make then run (software).

We'll examine new products and
\ translate the information we
uncover. We'll have a writing and
editorial style that’s light and
entertaining without being flip. (All
right, we'll be flip once in a while,
too.) To balance our positive style,
we'll have an anti-style against. the
JARGON many people love to use.

We'll set the type and headlines
for this publication using our
printers. We plan to incorporate
many computer graphics, that is
illustrations generated using the
computer. We'll tell you what
software, hardware, and methods ve
use to achieve different effects.

The single sost important step
when buying 3 computer is to know
what you want it to do. Then find
the merchandise that will fill your
needs and/or desires. We'll try te
help.
After all, it’s all very well te
get the answers to questions. But
what if you don’t know the questions
to ask? We hope to help you with the
questions...and quite a few answers.

@ way, if you already have
questions you’d like answered, write

for less and that’s what the KAYPRO provides. The large
readable 9” green screen with an 80 column by 24 row display
says it all. Two 5%” Double Density disc drives hold up to
200K each, but are versatile enough to read single density ©
diskettes also. The KAYPRO II has a fully sculptured keyboard
and a 14 key numeric’pad. A Centronics parallel port along
with a RS 232 C serial port will hook you up to just about
anything (Printers, modems, etc.) The complete package also

The robot would need to figure out what each number was, and display the result using a print,
command. In this world, the result would be 18+37+2+30+12, for a total of 9.

Requirements

  

Create a defined command that will add up the total number of beepers on the robot's current row.
The command should return the value of the number on that row.

 

The general approach should be to move all the way to the far wall, and start picking up beepers on

the right end of the number. Those beepers are the ones digits, so each beeper counts as just 1. The
next digit to the left counts as the tens, then the one hundreds, etc. Keep going until you get back to
the left wall

This will require some thought about your coding, and about using variables. We will go through
the concepts of the algorithm in class, but you will have to fill in the details and code it yourself.

  

Call that defined command for each row, adding the result to a running total. At the end, print out
the running total.

Stack Developers

In 2022

Check The Qua ry

* They must be knowledgeable and experienced in
the industry

* Knowledge of various technologies, and able to
steer the project in the right direction, understand
the customer's challenges, and work according to
the vision of the company

Check Project Management Skills

Full stack developers are exceptional project managers.
Business development teams may not understand all the
technical aspects of development. However, experienced
developers can manage technical teams and even lead the
project.

 

Hire Full Stack Developers Based
On Technical Skills

HTML and CSS skills : These skills are crucial to build an
attractive user interface. Other front-end skills that can be
beneficial for your projects include frameworks like AngularJS,
Backbonejs, Vue.js, and Bootstrap with libraries like React,
AnyChart, and jQuery.

  

Assess The Grasp On Diverse
Technologies

Your potential candidate must have an excellent grasp on
technologies used for web services, front-end, back-end
development, and be capable of managing databases.

Assess Development Portfolio

An experienced developer must have a reliable portfolio
of previous development projects. Ask them to show you
the work samples so you can get an idea of his/her
expertise. It doesn’t mean weeding out inexperienced
developers, they start out in the industry and are ready
to learn more on the job.

ri

Evaluate The Knowledge Of Technological

Advancements
A dedicated full stack web developer must be familiar with and
equipped with all the new and evolving technology trends to
implement in full stack projects. As technology continues to evolve,
these developers must understand the needs and expectations of
ites

Look For Additional Qualities

A full stack developer will work on many projects, and
therefore, they should have the proper knowledge and
understanding of business requirements. They should
not only know the technical terms but also know how
to deal with customers, which helps to clarify doubts
and questions from customers.

Analyze And Hire The Best Full

Stack Developer
Because it’s a complex task to choose the right developers, you
can directly go to a full stack development company. You should
better avoid risks in the business and choose developers who are
highly skilled and know all the technical aspects of the full stack
development process.

Decision trees in scikit-learn

scikit-learn uses an optimised version of the CART algorithm.

However, scikit-learn implementation does not support categorical features for now.

scikit-learn implements a DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor in
sklearn.tree module.

Some parameters:

cf} ff

"" criterion {“gini”, “entropy”}, default=""gini” : The function to measure the quality of
a split.

splitter {“best” “random”}, default=""best”: The strategy used to choose the split at
each node.

min_samples_split int or float, default=2: The minimum number of samples
required to split an internal node.

max_depth int, defau/t=None: The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes
are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
min_samples_split samples.

We ask you to write a Python program in the code cell below, based on the program above, that should:
e Read the fasta file mystery2.fasta.
e Store the results in a variable called seqRec and print the key features of the sequence.
e Store the contents of seqRec into the Seq variable called newSeq.

e Using the commands of the form:

pattern2=newSeq[1:]

  
  
 
  
  
    

define 6 Seq variables called pattern1, pattern2, pattern3, pattern4, patternS and pattern 6, such that pattern1, pattern2 and pattern3 contain the original nucleotide sequence in newSeq but starting a

PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT 2 |

Overview: This assignment tests your understanding of list and for statement.

Write a program that computes the minimum, maximum, sum, mean, mode, median, and SRERE d
deviation of an array of numbers entered by the user. An example run of this program is shown

stanGard Deviation = 4.157990967870047
The mean or average is sum of the values in the list and then dividing the sum by the number of —
Values in the list. a

The median is the value that has the same number of values less than it ahd Qreaterthanit. Thus,for
an even number of elements (say, ten), there are likely to be two ates forthe median. Either —s_—/
one is fine. While there are multiple valid ways ta solve this probler onsider putting the elementsof —s_—
the array in order before attempting to find the median. This migh 'even help with some of the other __
parts of the problem.  .. |

    
     
   

The mode of a set of numbers is that number which occurs most frequent
example given this is unambiguous, but it is possible to have multiple val
the same number of times. In this case. it is fine to print any one of or al

y. In the

Finally, the standard deviation has a slightly more complicated definition. In English,
sum the squares of the differences between each element and the average, then divid
one less than the number of elements, and take the square

Testing is an activity carried out
by testers to find defects in the
software and reported to the

development team for correction.

Itis either executed manually or
through automation

+ Helps in identifying and fixing
bugs.

+ Ensure software performance
when integrated with other
existing legacy systems.

+ Performs root cause analysis
which increases the efficiency
of the software.

+ Ensure the reliability of
software.

+ Black Box Testing.
+ White Box Testing.
+ Unit Testing,

+ Integration Testing.
+ Functional Testing.
= System Testing.

* Stress Testing.

* Usability Testing.

* Performance Testing,
* Acceptance Testing.
« Beta Testing.

+ Regression Testing.

   

 

Debugging is the activity carried
out by the development team
after getting the test report
about the defects from the

testing team.

+ Reports error condition
immediately.

* Provides maximum useful
information on data structures.

* Minimizes useless and
distracting information.

* Helps in avoiding complex one-
use testing code.

 

Brute Force: Requires a little
thought process and is the least
mentally taxing of all the other
approaches.

Induction: Allows a developer to
discover most errors in the design
and code of the software, without
going near the computer.
Deduction: Goes through some of
the general theories & properties
of the errors while using the
method of elimination &
refinement to conclude.

Assignment two — cin and cout

This assignment is to practice creating and using
variables.

You will need to define 10 variables (of type int and
string) to hold the following types of information:

2 places

1 adjective

3 nouns

2 numbers

2 foods

It helps if you give your variables meaningful names.

Your program will ask the user to enter the appropriate
data. Your program will read the data in using cin
statement(s).

Once all the data has been entered you will output the
following story (using cout) substituting the data you
read in for the part of speech within the <>.

<adjective1><noun1>

By <insert your name here>
There was an <adjective1> <noun1> who lived in a
<place1>,
She had <number1> <noun2> and <number2>
<noun3> she didn’t know what to do.
She gave them some <food1> with plenty of <food2>,
She <verb> all <number1+number2> of them fondly
and sent them to <place2>.

2. The string y consists only of 1s. This case also gives a contradiction.

3. The string y consists of both 0s and 1s. In this case, the string xyy2 may
have the same number of 0s and 1s, but they will be out of order with some

components in other circuits. This allows you to build up complex circuits
from simpler circuits (just like you make complex programs from simpler
subroutines). To create a new circuit, use the ""Add Circuit"" command in
the ""Project"" menu. You will be asked for a circuit name. Enter a
name. The circuit that you have created is added to the palette of circuit
elements in the upper left portion of the window, under the name of the file
that you are working in (probably ""Untitled""). To view and edit a circuit that
you have created, double-click its name in the list.) you can use this created

circuit in other complex circuits.

- Sometime, you may find Logisim giving you blue ""error"" wires, sometimes
because they haven't been connected yet, but sometimes it seems like it does
this for no reason at all. If there is not an actual problem with the circuit, you
can try this: Give the ""Reset Simulation"" command (Control-R, or find it in
the ""Simulate"" menu). Try turning simulation off and on, using Control-E (or
""Enable Simulation"" in the ""Simulate"" menu). And make sure that you haven't

connected two inputs of some circuit with a wire.

13060,"CONSISTENTLY PRAY

Consistently Pray for forgiveness,
guidance in a good (positive) direction,
and for help against evil. Pray to be
saved from hell (whatever that may be).
Pray for your friends and your family too,
it only takes a minute or so/less at a
time to pray. Do it and your life will
slowly get better, or maybe quickly. It
probably just depends on you and the
kind of person you are/have been. Don't
wait until its too late and you have to
suffer the consequences of built up bad
karma from immoral acts/unrepented
sins. Maybe together we can help make
the world a better place by changing
ourselves for the better, and changing
things around us for the better.

And addressing/thanking the CREATOR,
LORD GOD at the beginning and end of
your prayers would be a good idea & or
just be my friend if you don't want to say
the prayer &

particularly affected media that called for disobedience to existing laws,
but also those in which organs, facilities, authorities, or leading officials of
the state were attacked by means of false statements. After Hitler came to
power on February 4, 1933, the decree of the President of the Reich for
the protection of the German people came into force. Among other
things, this not only abolished the basic right to freedom of opinion and
freedom of the press, but also explicitly prohibited the dissemination of
“incorrect news’. In the future, the Reich Ministry for Public
Enlightenment and Propaganda determined what was right and what was

wrong.

NASA has attempted four times to delete the scientific data against it.
CERN intervened and violated the DATACITE commitment to preserve
data by deleting the evidence against NASA. What do you know about
Fake News? In Nazi Germany, Hitler used Lugenpresse to gain power. Do
you understand what misinformation is? Because in Hitler used it to shut
down any news source against him. It was called “Falschmeldung!” And
this is how the Nazis seized power. Do you know how many Nazi SS were

involved in the establishment of NASI — err— NASA?
 15

 

The evidence that conveniently disappeared three times shows how
NASA is responsible for the bot situation and now it has been deleted
from Zenodo, which is a DATACITE repository and thus cannot be
deleted; but it has been deleted. The information concerned how these
bots are modeling all citizens to be pushover, paranoid individuals afraid

of their own government. The government is not one, but many.

The evidence directly against them showed how the moon landing was
faked. It showed new forensic evidence that they had been lying and gas
lighting the nation this entire time causing mental health to reduce. The
method for extracting black holes and the “Framework of the Universe”

demonstrated NASA’s incompetence.

In these records included the photos of the Moon Landing and the

evidence that clearly shows that it was false.

The best time to use a semicolon is when you feel a long pause would be
more beneficial than a short pause or full stop. It is useful when you have
two sentence fragments that don’t complement each other but are still
part of the overall sentence structure. The most desired use is when you
need to start a sentence with the following: at, because, but, is, or, it, of,

with, from, also, in, and — and.

There are some awkward sentences where one might be stuck with an “is
| is,” but the way to get around that is to rewrite your sentence; if you do
not wish to do that, then you simply add an em-dash — and you can do so
on Windows by holding ALT followed by 0151. You could write this as

such: “is, is,” but that bothers me because it feels clunky.

“Whatever it is — is gone,” feels far more appropriate than: “Whatever it
is, is gone.” An em-dash is a great way to conclude a sentence — and if
you're using an em-dash to end a sentence, you should use at most five words
as it can be confused for this inner thought — or to add a thought within a
sentence; however, it is always good practice to mark those inner

thoughts by italicizing them.

When I read, I instinctively reject scanning the information, and instead

read it as if I were giving a lecture or rehearsing a theatre role.
  
 them this entire time. This book sets a few things straight. It was all by
accident too. Which proves how false Nazi mathematics are.

I am aware that my actions are not favored by many. I do not do this
research to receive popularity, but rather for the progression of all
humankind. Is it better to glorify liars, swindlers, and frauds with
fraudulent works, or to admit that it wasn't real to have a little bit of
integrity ?

This book has science, history, and the tactics of manipulation used upon
humans for hundreds of years. A tactic used is congruence. If they rush
riot review enough, you will ignore it, thus banning content without
banning it; even when I had alternative mathematics for landing on the
moon, the idea that the moon landing was false never struck me until I
invented a method to extract black holes from photographs which I was
to use to disprove conspiracy theorists. Fake News and Misinformation

went by other terms many years ago: Lugenpresse und Falschmeldung.
 The first thing one should do is look up Kurt Debus: a Nazi S.S. member, and
you will get an image of why no one has proven the moon hoax despite such
flaws. Is it still patriotic to celebrate the enemy?

As soon as I posted the above screenshot to Reddit; it was removed by

large corporations, it’s the snakes within that repel knowledge. I would still
look at the CEOs of each as they have allowed this to happen.

The great thing about the United States is that it is not one entity. FBI agents
hold each other accountable and find anyone that attempts to harm this

 route. If an asteroid exists, it will need to be pushed through
electromagnetic means over time to change its trajectory.

This concept is simple to understand. Find any video of an asteroid,
meteor, or whatever you want to call it— because you understand what I
am referring to—and you ll see that the asteroids with a green glowing
light will slow and trickle away and even glide across the sky. The orange-
glowing asteroids accelerate and become as bright as the sun. The reason
for this is because asteroids with a green glow are of negative origin,
therefore the borealis it causes as it impacts the atmosphere. As they
accelerate, the positive asteroids burn up. The meteorites which break
apart into many tend to consist of both positive and negative polarities
which causes the break in the first place.

The huge asteroid belt exists because those asteroids are positive, and our
sun is positive. It is basic, which is why it appears so simple, but no one
can modify their first learned ideology. New concepts are created with just
a little imagination. Magnetic bursts.

However, this does not fit in with Aryan Physics, which means there will
be push-back against this. If you are shocked about Aryan physics, you
may be shocked to discover that you've been adhering to Nazi
Mathematics. The reason being because ""Nazi’ mathematics disproves

much of ‘Jewish’ physics aka Modern Physics. You've been living under

Lugenpresse (Fake News) und Falschmeldung

(Misinformation. )

Antisemitism on the rise.

I discovered that these “bots” promoted ludicrous conspiracies to
undermine actual conspiracies. 100s of thousands of comments nearly
identical to one another about Bill Gates, Qanon, Pizza-Gate, Masks,
Anti-Science, “Repent for Your Sins,” among other anti-LGBT and

antisemitic comments.

It is a brilliant idea. Discredit the very thing someone accuses you of; and
then discredit the accuser by associating of the very thing they have
discredited. It is very reminiscent of Nazi manipulation. Fortunately,
manipulation is something I have accidently studied all my life. When you
study history, you tend to catch on to a few things. The most effective
form of manipulation is to be closely and vaguely related many times over
to the accusation that it appears to be completely insane to associate the
two. If I were secretly Adolf Hitler; the best way to get law enforcement

to leave me alone would be to rename myself Rudolph Hilter. Imagine a
 11

[comma] = short pause, followed by an articulated syllable in the style of
a marcato. The best way I can explain this, if you do not know what a
marcato is; a marcato is a musical-articulated note that is attacked with a

soft force (meaning louder than the baseline) and fades into a nearly

immeasurably short cutoff: bah, bah, bahh, bah.

We can use the above description as an example: a short pause followed
by a marcato. You don’t want to sound as if you're yelling that first
syllable, but you will want to distinguish your voice slightly to allow others

to know you're moving onto the next part of the sentence.

[semicolon] = long pause, followed by a slow rising syllable on the first
word; and then articulating the second word in the same manner we did
above. You can read it however you'd like to. I am only stating this
because there are those who completely skip commas and semicolons

because they were never taught to read the pauses.

You must be the person giving the lecture. Who, in your mind,

was a great lecturer? Great, mimic that person with your voice while

 

reading my words as if they were yours. You are now the teacher. You are
giving the lecture, and that is how you can better understand any material

that you read.

call coming from someone, “I just saw Adolf Hitler, and he goes by the
name, ‘Rudolph Hilter’ now,” they'd hang up instantly. In history, it has
been the most comical, and most brilliant form of disguise. It’s so hidden,

that you fail to see it under your nose.

The Nazis’ trademark was rush rioting. In essence: they instilled the
general population with such skepticism in the populace that other
humans did not know what to believe, so they decided to trust the

congruity (what the majority believe.)

Blitzkrawall was a word I had learned long ago but can no longer find a
source for. It is much like how I can no longer find adequate sources for
falschmeldung unless I look on Searx. This uncertainty made it possible
for the rush rioters to rush politicians and anyone else in public by creating
a lot of noise and yelling questions and assumptions, allowing others to
witness the discrediting of the target. The seeds were subsequently
planted in society, which completed the remaining task of pressuring

others.

In Germany, during the Weimar Republic, emergency decrees enabled
various countermeasures against false reports: in 1931 alone, 516
newspaper bans were issued based on the Republic Protection Act and

379 by means of emergency decrees because of false reports. This

 The Semicolon is Your Best Friend
How it Aids in Speaking, Reading, and Understanding.

If you have never developed, or were never taught about semicolons; then this

first part may frustrate you:

If I wanted to, I could write this entire article as a single sentence using
semicolons; but I won't do this; at least, not right now; because, you see,
the semicolon is very particular; it indicates a pause or a break between
ideas; even if the ideas are sentence fragments, to a semicolon: it does not
matter; because the semicolon is a long breath within the same idea, or
sentence; just as a comma is a short breath between points; but the best

thing about this — is that it passes all grammatical checks.

How and when to use a semicolon:

The colon is far different from a semicolon; the colon indicates the results.
If I said there was a mystery meal for dinner tonight, I would conclude
that with: turkey on rye poured over with gravy. It is also used before lists,

after greetings, and in a few other obscure and obvious use cases.

This is the fourth time that this has happened, and it is by no mistake. I
am calling on every government agency willing to do so to investigate with
checks and balance the National Aeron-autics Space Administration. I
found it extremely discomforting to know that two of their astronauts of
Jewish descent died in a fiery explosion and were warned that it would

happen.
 Most ignore the introductory content, but a

reiteration is beneficial even to those that read it:

Humans tend to experience feelings of nausea and dread when confronted
with information that contradicts their existing beliefs. This reaction is
likely due to the way we are trained from a young age to accept certain
ideologies and worldviews. When faced with information that challenges
our existing beliefs, we may feel a sense of panic or anxiety as our brain
tries to process this new information. In some cases, we may even lash out

to repress the memory of this event.

When confronted with knowledge that contradicts what we know to be
true, it is typical to experience nausea, impending doom, with a need to
shut down and lash out. To avoid this reaction, I've learned that when
needed: that meditating with my head resting, and shoulders relaxed
assists my brain assimilate the information while listening to instrumental
music and allowing my imagination to wander on its own. I feel refreshed

and determined to continue after a few minutes.

There is a serious study making the rounds, “is the universe changing the

laws of physics?” The answer is no, and that is horribly delusional.
 Itis simple to refute and disprove the moon landing. It's

difficult to discover why you can't.

NASA‘s own statements can be used to refute the moon landing. They
claim to be reflecting lasers from the moon that were planted there 50
years ago, but when asked why we can't see the flag on the moon, they say
""it fell over and was covered by moon dust."" In those two statements, we
can see that NASA is not only lying, but is also responsible for gaslighting
American citizens. If the flag is covered in dust; so are the reflectors. When
demonstrating, what are these ‘scientists’ bouncing a laser off? Perhaps,
logically, they re reflecting from one of hundreds of satellites equipped
with mirrors.

NASA doesn't understand the universe; and I will put these in simple
terms because the universe is the same. If you want to deflect an asteroid,
you must first determine the polarity. If it is positive. We ll be hit. If it is
negative, it will slingshot around our planet unless it is in a direct course
for collision. If there was an asteroid; it would need to be pushed via
electromagnetic means over time to change the trajectory. NASA does
not comprehend the universe. To deflect an asteroid, you must first
establish its polarity. If the answer is positive. We're going to get hit. If it

is negative, it will slingshot around our globe unless it is on a collision

4917,"The etymology of command-line

 

Awk

The command-line text manipulation utility and
programming language awk is an acronym using
the first initials of its creators’ surnames: Alfred
‘Aho, Peter Weinberger and Brian Kernighan.

It is pronounced ‘auk’ like the seabird of the
Alcidae bird family that features on the cover of
The AWK Programming Language book.

Cat

The Unix command utility cat that can join
files together and print them as an output is a
shortening of the word concatenate meaning
‘to link together in a chain or series’. The
word concatenate comes from the Latin
concaténare meaning ‘to link together’ from
con- ‘together’ + caténare ‘to chain’

cURL

The command-line tool and library cURL that
can transfer data to and from a server is a
combination of the words ‘client’ and ‘URL’
(uniform resource locator). Although cURL
also works as a recursive acronym for ""Curl
URL Request Library”, creator Daniel Stenberg
said: ""While that is awesome, it was actually
not the original thought.""

 

Emacs

The text editor Emacs is short for ‘editing
macros’. Author Richard Stallman, who worked
on the worked on Emacs in the Al laboratory
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT), said: “I wanted the new editor to have
a single-letter abbreviation, and the letter ""E""
was one of the ones not in use.”

  

)

 

tools

Finger

The Unix command finger that displays
information about users logged into a host was
named after the act of pointing. Creator Les
Earnest got the idea from watching colleagues
run their fingers down a list of IDs on the
computer screen to find out who was logged in.
Finger may stem from the Proto-Indo- European
word *penkwe- meaning ‘five’.

Fortune

The fortune command that prints random
quotes takes its name from the fortune cookie:
It first appeared in version 7 of the Unix,
inspired by the cookies containing paper
prophecies served in Chinese restaurants in the
United States and other western countries.
Fortune comes from the Latin fortuna meaning
‘fate or luck’.

Grep

The Unix command-line utility grep that can
search plain text for patterns is an acronym
for ‘global regular expression print’. The
program was written by Unix designer Ken
Thompson who named it after the command
*g/re/p* that was used to search the original
Unix text editor ed.

Man

The man command used to invoke the
reference documentation for a program is
short for ‘man page’ or ‘manual page’. The
word manual comes from the Latin manuale
meaning ‘a handbook’, stemming from the
Proto-Indo-European root -man (‘hand’).

@thestrangeroots

¢
a
%

Ping

The network utility ping that tests the
connectivity between two devices takes its
name from the sound that sonar makes.
Ping creator Mike Muuss said it was inspired
by the principle of echo-location. The word
ping is imitative of a short, high-pitched
metallic ringing sound, originally referring to
the sound of gunfire from the 1800s.

Sudo

The Unix command sudo that allows users to
run programs with security privileges is a
concatenation of ‘superuser’ (someone with
admin privileges) and ‘do’. The first edition of
the Unix manual printed in 1971 noted that.
the “su’ command “allows one to become the
super—user, who has all sorts of marvelous
powers”.

Tar

The Unix command utility tar that can save
multiple files in an archive is short for ‘tape
archiver’. The name derives from when Unix
admins would backup files on physical tapes
The save file is called a tarball, a play on the
fact that the files are rolled together like the
sticky blob of tar. The word tar comes from
the Old English teru meaning ‘tar or resin’ from
Proto-Indo-European *derwo- ‘tree’.

Vim

The ubigitous text editor for Unix is a
contraction of ‘vi improved’ as it was a clone
of the *vi° editor written by Bill Joy in 1976.
Viis an acronym for ‘visual interface’ as it was
created to be the interface for “ex”, Joy's
improved version of *ed*, the original Unix
text editor created by Ken Thompson.

Markets:

Markets plunged again today as the DJI led all other major indices lower, losing 545 points
(over 2.1%) by the close. From the peak of October 3 to today's low, the DJI lost over 2000
points. As we said last week, watch the air being let out of all the upward manipulated stocks,
which includes the 30 large caps stocks in the DJI.

The S&P 500 also plummeted by over 2%, now on a 6-day losing streak, while the Russell

Page 1 of 9

 

 

 

2000 fell 1.9%. Daily moves over 1% in an index are considered meaningful. Over 2% is
significant.

Tech stocks were not as week today as they were yesterday, which led to the NASDAQ having
the smallest loss today, although it was down 1.3%.

All four major indices are now below their 200-day moving averages, a level that the DJI,
NASDAQ, nor the Russell 2000 has closed below anytime this year. That suggests they are
in bear markets or on the way there.

The VIX (volatility/fear index) hit its highest level since the super-fast plunge going into
February 12"" and is now near 25.

At the close, there were 529 stocks making new 52 week lows on the NYSE, which was higher
than the 502 yesterday. That's bearish. It means that even more stocks were weaker today than
yesterday.

Lhis project will require you to write two Java programs.

I. Calculate by hand the actual value of f'(0), where f(x) = sinx — cosz.

2. Your first program will use the two-point forward-difference formula for

 

f(0), where f(x) = sinz —cosz, with h = 10S pO Ss 10 Your
program will create a table with columns i, h, 2Point, Error. The column
2 gives the loop number, h is given by h = lOpe ie 107*°, 2Point is
the estimated derivative, and Error is given by the absolute value of the
estimated derivative subtracted from the actual value of the derivative.
Include a print out of your computer program and a print out of your
table.

Your second program will use the three-point centered-difference formula
tony (0), where f(r) = sinx — cosz, with h = 1071,10-?,... 19-22.
Your program will create a table with columns 1,h,3Point, Error. The

EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE

WHAT IS THE
INTERNET OF THINGS (101)?

The Internet of Things isa system made up of physical
devices connected by the internet and capable of
accumulating and sharing data across a network. While
the platforms used to develop loT devices can differ,

they all have the same core components in common
when it comes to their architecture.

10T EXAMPLES
if you purchased an Apple watch or Google Home fe
device in recent years, you became part ofthe oT
revolution. Other Intenet of Things applications
include Alexa, Ring, andthe Amazon dash button
that lets you reorder you favorite candy bars
‘when you are running low.

 

f lor GROWTH
f tn 2015, small business and mid-sized companies did
‘nothave oT technology as priority. Fast foward to
today, and many of them now rely on devices for
handling day today business.

Seven billion devices were connecting to the internet
in 2018, with that number expected to reach anywhere
from 10to 14 billion by 2020.

Researchers estimate that the average person will have
atleast four connected devices by 2021.

Experts 2lso expect the value ofthe fof market to
exceed 1.5ilion by the year 2025.

computer science and idek if this sub is right for these
types of questions, please Imk. Also this is my first time
ever posting so please don't judge.

| really need to know the solutions for this question, as
my grade depends on it and | have tried researching for
it but couldnt really find anything on google. Basically,
there's a scenario where there's a user and an IT
person working in an office. Now the user is using
their computer, trying to save the new data they just
researched, but its not saving. Their trying to use other
windows utilities but its showing an error. They've even
tried to backup their data and its starts, goes to 30%
and shows an error. Now the user has been trained
that in times like these, such problems can be fixed

by restarting the computer so the user restarted the
computer 3 times and everytime it still was showing
the same errors, so now it was IT person's turn. The
user told the IT person that they've tried every which
way possible to fix the issue but they couldn't. IT person
double tests everything just to make sure and finds out
that the problem is in the Windows System, but since
that new data couldn't be saved or backed up, they
cant reinstall it, so they need to find alternative ways
to somehow fix the problem without losing any sorts
of data. They've also been give just a few hours since
the data required is really urgently and needed for an
important project.

Can someone please help me solve this, as ive tried my
level best to search for the answer but i couldn't. If this
isn't the appropriate sub please inform me as well. PS
English isn't my first language, please don't judge.

reat quotes heard by the ‘‘Why did
(5 get into data processing?’ school
of thought are, ‘Your charge-back
system stinks — it bills me a different

amount every time I run a job,’ “I want

to run all my jobs on the 3090 instead of .

the 3084 because it costs less,’’ ‘Your
new operating system stinks — now my
jobs cost twice as much to run,’ ‘‘You
were overcharging me before the new op-
erating system was put in because now
my jobs cost half as much,”’ ‘*Can’t you
get anything right,’’ “‘It wasn’t like this
back in the good, old 158 days,’’ *“Why
can’t you just charge in 158 hours?’’!!!!
If you have heard comments like these,
continue reading! This article discusses the
reasons for differing charges based on
CPU time used. (The discussion could
continue if I also took on I/O charges and
storage charges. However, for now I will
concentrate on CPU variances.) While I
have used MVS for most of my examples,
the concepts apply to both VM and VSE.
A fact of life: CPU time varjes from
one run to the next even when using the
same program and the same data. This
generally plays havoc with charge-back
systems, capacity plans and management
reporting systems. Take a look at some
CPU variability in two cases: a stand-
alone, benchmark situation and a normal
multiprogramming environment with other

56

jobs running. In both cases, assume that
you want to evaluate a job that uses the
same data every run.

Stand-alone Benchmark

Most people do not have the luxury of
running a stand-alone benchmark test.
However, variabilities still exist due to the
hardware microcode and software differ-
ences. Hardware variabilities exist due to:
instruction speeds, pipelining (based on
Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs) and
CPU cache buffers) and multiprocessing
effects. Software differences occur be-
cause of the software releases, program
location, product changes, software pa-
rameters and configuration differences.

Instruction Speeds

Each processor has a given speed for a
single cycle with the more expensive
processors having faster cycle speeds.
However, this is not a true indication of
instruction speed since instructions can
take a single cycle or multiple cycles. Ad-
ditionally, vendors do not use the same
microcode for instructions so one vendor
may have fast addition and move instruc-
tions while another vendor has faster mul-
tiplies and branch instructions. Given two
programs (like benchmark programs),
some will run faster on the first processor
while the other will run faster on the sec-

ond processor,simply because of the mix
of instructions. In fact, some well-known
benchmark tests, such as Whetstone and
Megaflops, attempt to provide a mix of
instructions to test all processors. (Note:
beware of benchmark tests provided by
vendors — they know which instructions
run better on their machines!) Unfortu-
nately, standard benchmarks do not ade-
quately match your environment. As an
example, most COBOL applications con-
sist of 50 percent code that moves data to
and from memory (rather than in regis-
ters). Therefore, COBOL applications do
better on processors that have fast mem-
ory move instructions.

The reason that ‘‘MIP’’ ratings (Mil-
lions of Instructions Per Second) are dis-
trusted is that the rate depends on which
instructions are being executed. What can
you do? Run your own tests based on se-
lected samples of your workload and
compare the results. Speaking of MIPs,
you have probably noticed that some ven-
dors are refusing to rate their machines in
MIPs anymore because of the variability
of the instruction speeds and other fac-
tors. IBM, however, does publish a factor
that is used to determine Service Units
(SU). SUs were designed to be machine
independent measurements of resource
usage: CPU, I/O and memory. The MVS

A centralized database framework is a framework that keeps the
information in one single database at one single place.

     
  
  
     
     
   

Personal Database

Information is gathered and stored on PCs, which is in small
quantity and can easily manageable.

Relational Database

Its described by a set of tables from where data can be accessed,
Relational database can store a large amount of information in a
setof tables, which are linked to each other

 

Operational Database

‘An operational database is utilized to store and manage a huge
‘amount of data in realtime.

Hierarchical Database

In hierarchical database model, data is organized in a tree structure
that links a number of different elements to one parent record.

Cloud Database

It is deployed and delivered through a cloud platform like Platform-
‘a-a-Service (PaaS) that permits the organizations & their
applications to store and mange information from the cloud.

Itis agroup of object-oriented programming and relational

between them. This time, he wants to take a 3 digit number and see if the sum

of the squares of all its digits taken separately is equal to that of another 3 di
number. Help Mr Ramanujan to do this.

However, a lower resolution copy of Figure 1.1 (for example, 1024 x 798) would
now fit on the screen without any modification to the image. We could simply
zoom in to enlarge it to full screen size; however, the image could now become
pixelated (in other words, the number of pixels per square inch (known as the
pixel density) is smaller, causing deterioration in the image quality).

We will now consider a calculation which shows how pixel density can be

calculated for a given screen. Imagine we are using an Apple iPhone 8 which

has 5.5-inch screen size and screen resolution of 1920 pixels x 1080 pixels:

1 add together the squares of the resolution size ((19202 + 10802) = (3 686 400
+ 16640) = 4852800)

2 find the square root (4852800 = 202.907)

3. divide by screen size (2202.907 + 5.5 = 401)

This gives us the pixel density of 401 pixels per square inch (ppi) (which is the

same as the published figure from the manufacturer).

   

A pixel-generated image can be scaled up or scaled down; it is important

to understand that this can be done when deciding on the resolution. The
resolution can be varied on many cameras before taking, for example, a digital
photograph. When magnifying an image, the number of pixels that makes up
the image remains the same but the area they cover is now increased. This
means some of the sharpness could be lost. This is known as the pixel density
and is key when scaling up photographs. For example, look at Figure 1.3.

Turing's fascinating and remarkable theory, which now forms the basis of computer
science, explained for the general reader.

In 1936, when he was just twenty-four years old, Alan Turing wrote a remarkable paper in
which he outlined the theory of computation, laying out the ideas that underlie all modern

Moving the Walker
Have the walker (which starts at the origin, (0,0)) take the sequence of steps listed in
Table 2. For each step, write the ending coordinates in the empty cell. That is, write
the x and y coordinates describing the position of the walker after it has finished the
step. Don’t forget to draw the arrows on your diagram too! 5pts.

Reaching the Boundary
Once you are finished with this process, determine whether the walker hit the boundary.
Did it? And, how would you know?

If it did not, come up with a few more “random” steps that you could have the walker
take, and take those steps. Record the direction and ending coordinates. Continue this
until the walker has hit the boundary, then stop. Use the next page to record your steps,
and your thoughts regarding reaching the boundary.

Of particular note, consider how you would determine which boundary was crossed. Can
you come up wie a check for each of the oo boundaries? 5pts.

8496,"For sorted arrays, we can implement insert and delete in linear time, and mini-
mum in constant time. However, all priority queue deletions involve only the min-
imum element. By storing the sorted array in reverse order (largest value on top),
the minimum element will be the last one in the array. Deleting the tail element
requires no movement of any items, just decrementing the number of remaining
items n, and so delete-minimum can be implemented in constant time.

All this is fine, yet the following table claims we can implement find-minimum
in constant time for each data structure:

 

 

Unsorted Sorted Balanced

array array tree
Insert (Q, x) oO(1) O(n) O(log n)
Find-Minimum(Q) O(1) O(a) O(1)
Delete-Minimum(Q) | O(n) oO(i) O(log n)

 

 

 

 

The trick is using an extra variable to store a pointer/index to the minimum
entry in each of these structures, so we can simply return this value whenever we
are asked to find-minimum. Updating this pointer on each insertion is easy—we
update it if and only if the newly inserted value is less than the current minimum.
But what happens on a delete-minimum? We can delete the minimum entry have,
then do an honest find-minimum to restore our canned value. The honest. find-
minimum takes linear time on an unsorted array and logarithmic time on a tree,
and hence can be folded into the cost of each deletion. &

7361,"2. Suppose there is a randomized algorithm with worst case runtime at most T on inputs
of size n. Let I,, be the set of all inputs of size n. On every input in I,, the algorithm
produces incorrect output with probability at most e. A probability distribution over
I, is a function that assigns a non-negative value j1(x) to each input x in I, such that
Dxer, H(x) = 1. Prove that for every probability distribution 1 over In, there exists a
deterministic algorithm with worst case runtime at most T on inputs in I,,, such that
the probability of error of the algorithm for a random input picked from I,, according
to pis at most e.

(Hint: Recall that a randomized algorithm has access to a stream of independent
unbiased bits. The number of random bits that the algorithm uses is bounded by its
runtime. Also, a randomized algorithm can be turned into a deterministic one by
fixing the random bits to specific values.]

[The motivation of the above problem is in proving limitation of randomized algorithms;
to show that there is no efficient randomized algorithms for a problem, it is sufficient
to show that there exists a “hard” input distribution \ for which there is no efficient
deterministic algorithm. ]

We are RESTful

Synapse has built a RESTful JSON API for you.
Which means, we use:

e POST to create a document
e PATCH to update it
e GET to query one or more documents

e DELETE to cancel or delete a document
(Subtext: nothing gets deleted. It is either
unindexed in case of a user or a bank account
or it's canceled in case of a transaction)

To make things easier, all GET calls that get
multiple documents support pagination and since
our primary database is mongoDB (that's why we
call everything documents), it also supports mongo
filters. Example call for retrieving LOCKED users,

Exercise 1

1

Consider your class representative wants to copy “Programming” materials
for the students. The price of copying 1 page is 50 IQD. He wants to know
how much does it cost to copy the materials for the students. Test your
solution with the following data:

= The material is 5 pages for 85 students.
An employee’s job in a printing company is to order paper for reports in
board meetings. The paper comes in sets of 500 sheets. He always makes
five more copies than the number of people that will be in the meeting. He
wants to know how many sets of paper he needs for a meeting. (Hint: He
can order only whole not partial sets). Test your solution with the following
data:

m= The report is 145 pages long and there will be 25 members at the meeting.
Write an algorithm to print the number of months (use 30 days for a month)
and remaining days given the number of days

A teacher would like to know if his student passed the exam or not. She
wants to enter students score.

Algorithms, Pseudo-code & Flowcharts

A
~ To develop an algorithm, we need to represent the

instructions in some way that the steps involved is
understandable to others. Two commonly used
representations for an algorithm is by using:

5 pseudo code

5 flow charts.

Question No 1:

Er

let's we have a class named Distance having two private data members such as feet(integer),
inches(float), one input function to input values to the data members, one Display function to show the
distance. The distance 5 feet and 6.4 inches should be displayed as 5’- 6.4”. Then add the two objects
of Distance class and then display the result (the + operator should be overloaded). You should also
take care of inches if it's more than 12 then the inches should be decremented by 12 and feet to be
incremented by 1. (5)

Write a program to print the following details (1+1+1.5+1.5)
Assign and print the ID of each employee,

Phone number and Address of two staff members having names ""ali"" and ""asif""
respectively by creating two objects of the class 'Employee’.

throw an exception in case the phone number of employee is inserted in float , double or
char value.

throw an exception in case the ID of an employee is inserted in float , double or char
value.

11929,"Advantages

 

of C Programming Language

C Language has a list of advantages due to this it is a very
much popular language around the world and best suitable
for the programmer to learn at the first stage of the
programming.

1 | Procedure Oriented Language

C Language is procedure-oriented language, here
user creates procedures or functions to execute
their task. Procedure-oriented language is very
much easy to learn because it follows an algorithm
to execute your statements.

6 Lots of Libraries

C Language provides lots of functions which consist
of system generated functions and user-defined
functions. C Compiler comes with a list of header files
which consist of many general functions which can be
used to develop a program, while the programmer can
also create a function as per their requirements that
are called a user-generated/defined function.

B Speed of Compilation

C compiler produces machine code very fast
compared to other language compilers. C compiler
can compile around 1000 lines of code in a second or
two. One more benefit of the C Compiler is that it
also optimize the code for faster execution.

4 | Easy to Learn

C Language syntax is very easy to understand. It
uses a keyword like if, else, goto, switch, main, etc.
This kind of keyword we all are using in our day to
day life to convey meaning or to get some decisions.

eB Portable

C Language setup is around 3-5 MB. So you can
carry this language in your Floppy Drive or Pen
Drive. It is very easy to install and operate, Again its
output is an exe file that can be executed on any
computer without any other framework/software.

In the grid above, fill the thermometers from the bulb end toward the non-bulb

end (regardless of orientation). The filling of a thermometer can stop at any point,

including no fill at all (even in the bulb), but spaces cannot be skipped over.
Numbers outside the grid state how many squares in that row or column contain
filled segments. When finished, add up the values of the thermometers marked
with an alpha (a) and alphaconvert (1A, 2=B, 3-0, etc.), followed by the
thermometers marked beta (B). gamma (y), delta (6), epsilon (e), and zeta (2)
The result spells a 6-letter object.

One of most pronounced benefits of using an array is
that it saves memory . The Array consists solely of data,
no space wasted on links and so if we lookup element i,
there is a high probability we will look up element i+/
next. But there’s a drawback which is ARRAY
OVERFLOW and to prevent this drawback memory
must be lost

QUESTION OF THE WEEK

How can an Array save memory and at

the same time waste space?

Your preparation for the examination should include attempting the following practical tasks by writing
and testing a program or programs.

A system is required to record and count votes for candidates in school council elections. The voting
system will allow for one representative to be elected from a tutor group. The school has between 28 and
35 students in each tutor group, five year groups named Year 7 to Year 11, and there are six tutor groups
in each year group. Tutor group names are their year group followed by a single letter e.g. 7A, 7B, etc.

All students are allowed to vote in the system. Each student may only vote once for a representative
from their tutor group in the election.

Write and test a program or programs for the voting system.

* Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data; data must be
validated on entry.

* Error messages and other output need to be set out clearly and understandably.

+ All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names.

You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested.

Task 1 — Setting up the voting system to allow a tutor group to elect a representative.

Write a program to:

* allow the tutor to enter the name of the tutor group

* allow the tutor to enter the number of students in the tutor group

* allow the tutor to enter the number of candidates in the election; maximum of four candidates
* allow the tutor to enter the names of the candidates and store them in a suitable data structure
* allow each student to input their vote or to abstain

* count the votes for each candidate and student abstentions.

When all students have voted, display the name of the tutor group, the votes for each candidate and the
name of the candidate who has won the election. If there is a tie for first place, display all candidates
with the equal highest number of votes.

Task 2 — Checking that students only vote once.
Each student is given a unique voter number by their teacher.
Extend Task 1 to achieve the following:
+ Allow students to enter their unique voter number before casting their vote.
* Check whether the student has already voted:
-  ifso, supply a suitable message and do not allow them to vote.
— if not, store the unique voter number, but not their vote, in a suitable data structure, and add
their vote to the relevant candidate count or abstention.

Task 3 — Showing statistics and dealing with a tie.

Extend Task 2 to achieve the following:

* Calculate the percentage of the votes that each candidate received from the number of votes cast,
excluding abstentions.

* Display the name of each candidate, the number of votes and the percentage of votes they
received from the number of votes cast, excluding abstentions.

* Display the total number of votes cast in the election and the number of abstentions.

* — In the event of a tie, allow the election to be immediately run again, with only the tied candidates
as candidates, and all the students from the tutor group voting again.

To You cee
Greetings!

| have to share bad news with you. Approximately a few months ago, |
gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing.
After that, | have started tracking your internet activities.

Here is the sequence of events:

Some time ago, | purchased access to email accounts from hackers
(nowadays, it is quite simple to buy it online). | have easily managed to
log in to your email account

One week later, | have already installed the Cobalt Strike ""Beacon"" on
the Operating Systems of all the devices you use to access your email.
It was not hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox
emails). All ingenious is simple. :).

This software provides me with access to all your devices controllers
(e.g., your microphone, video camera, and keyboard).

| have downloaded all your information, data, photos, videos,
documents, files, web browsing history to my servers. | have access to
all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history, and contacts
list.

My virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based) and
hence remains invisible for antivirus software. Likewise, | guess by now
you understand why | have stayed undetected until this letter.

While gathering information about you, i have discovered that you are a
big fan of adult websites. You love visiting porn websites and watching
exciting videos while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure. Well, i
have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a
few videos, which show how you masturbate and reach orgasms.

e Reliability

It means the accuracy of delivery. After the link failure, the time it
takes to recover is reliable.

e Good Performance

It can be measured by calculating the transmitting time and
response time. The time taken by a request to travel from one
device to another device is the transmission time. The time that a
request takes to respond is its response time.

e Security

The computer network can protect data through security.

This assignment revisits many of the concepts you learned in 1250. This command line program should

be written exactly as specified below. Points will be deducted if the naming does not match the
specification. If a detail is left out of the specification, its implementation is left to your discretion. The
program must compile and run. No credit will be given for a program that does not compile.

Deliverables: Drop the .java files only in the drop box for the 1250 review lab.

Create a class called Calculator
Calculator should:

Contain a double field called “result”
Contain a getter (accessor) for “result”
The following methods should all have a “void” return type
Contain a method called “add” that:
© Accepts two doubles as parameters
© Adds them together
© Stores the result in the “result” field
Contain a method called “subtract”
© Accepts two doubles as parameters
© Subtracts the second from the first
© Stores the result in “result”
Contain a method called “multiply”
© Accepts two doubles as parameters
© Multiplies the two numbers together
© Stores the result in “result”
Contain a method called “square”
© Accepts one double as a parameter
© Squares the input
© Stores the result in “result”
Contain a method called “clear” that sets “result” to 0

Create a driver class with a main method
Main should:

Create four instances of “Calculator” called “calc1”, “calc2”, “calc3”, and “calc”
Prompt the user for two numbers

8325,"TASK 1

Noel is creating a music quiz game.

The game stores a list of song names and their artist
(e.g. the band or solo artist name). The player needs to
try and guess the song name.

 

The game is played as follows:
*  Arandom song name and artist are chosen.
* The artist and the first letter of each word in the song title are displayed.
* The user has two chances to guess the name of the song.

* _ Ifthe user guesses the answer correctly the first time, they score 3 points. If the user guesses
the answer correctly the second time they score 1 point. The game repeats.

* The game ends when a player guesses the song name incorrectly the second time.
Only authorised players are allowed to play the game.

Where appropriate, input from the user should be validated.

Design, develop, test and evaluate a system that:

1. Allows a player to enter their details, which are then authenticated to ensure that they are an
authorised player.

2. Stores a list of song names and artists in an external file.

3. Selects a song from the file, displaying the artist and the first letter of each word of the song title.

=

Allows the user up to two chances to guess the name of the song, stopping the game if they guess
a song incorrectly on the second chance.

If the guess is correct, add the points to the player's score depending on the number of guesses.
Displays the number of points the player has when the game ends.

Stores the name of the player and their score in an external file.

on oa

Displays the score and player name of the top 5 winning scores from the external file.

spend the night studying for an upcoming exam.

To help them go through this, they brought one thermos
(Dallah) filled with Omani coffee (Qahwah), a plate of
Omani dates (Tamr), and three small empty coffee cups
(Funjan).

 

Assuming that:

e The Dallah can serve up to N number of Qahwah Funjans;
e Each student may fill up his Funjan from the Dallah (but only one student at a time); &
e Each student fills up his Funjan and drinks his Qahwah based on a randomly generated time/delay;

Your Task is simple:

Write a multithreaded simulation program (in C, C++ or Python3.8), for the above scenario, using basic semaphore
synchronization tools to ensure exclusive access to the Dallah.

 

The program must: Marks

(100)

e Execute/run and terminate appropriately, and without any errors (50% of the points shall be deducted -
automatically if not):

 

 

 

 

 

 

e Use threads to represent the three students; 30
e Synchronize students actions so that the Dallah can only be used by one student at a time; 30
e Display (slowly. based on time lapses) on screen the names of the current students (& thread IDs) 30
who are using the Dallah and the current number of Funjans that they are having (see sample below);
e _& Display the total number of Qahwah Funjans each student had. 10

Hey! Sorry about the tags <3. | thought

I'd share this because it's really
interesting. This has really impressed

account so far and | have already
doubled that amount 2 times so far: O |
just withdrawn all my winnings so | can
say this just works as described !!

Randomized algorithms do not require that results of each step
be uniquely defined.

Sometimes we use heuristics, which are not general:

or approximation algorithms which are not “correct” in the sense
that they provide a solution that is approximate rather than
exact - we'll explain this better later.

The data file will be organized as they are explained in the word file. However, some of the Se
information may be null or empty for this project. Moreover, the storm data is in a file. When Storm reads
the file, it must make sure the data in that file is internally consistent and alert the user to any errors

encountered if the file cannot be read. @

After reading and storing all storm data from the CSV file. Storm will enter a data manipulation loop (as
mentioned above). In this loop, Storm 1.0 will prompt the user with four options: ‘o’ for output, ‘sum’ for
summary, “f for find, and ‘q’ for quit (“Enter (o)utput, (sum)mary, (Hind, or (q)uit: ”). If the user selects
output, Storm 1.0 will prompt the user for a filename (“Enter output file name:_’) and read it in from the
console. If the user hits enter without specifying a filename, Storm 1.0 will send output to standard out.
Otherwise, it will attempt to open the specified file for writing. If the user enters the name of a file that is
not accessible, Storm 1.0 will report the error (“File is not available.”) and repeat the prompt for the file
name. If the file is accessible or the user has specified the standard out, Storm 1.0 will print out the storm
data in whichever order it is presently ordered, followed by a row showing the internal tallies, for example:

Data lines read: 15847; Storm records in memory: 15846

Other than possible differences in the order of the tows, the data output format of Storm 1.0 will exactly
match the output format used by the input file.

If the user selects sumumary, Storm 1.0 will prompt the user for the data year on which to report a summary

of the records (“Enter summary year: ”’). The user may select any numeric value from 0 to 9999 (inclusive),

which corresponds to the year number. If the user enters an invalid value for the data field on for summary,
Storm 1.0 will return to the data manipulation loop. If the user selects for the summary by any valid data
field, Storm 1.0 will print total INJURIES DIRECT. | total INJURIES INDIRECT _ total
DEATHS DIRECT, total DEATHS _ INDIRECT, total DAMAGE PROPERTY, total DAMAGE CROPS
for the given valid year as follows: I

Year: 2020; total INJURIES DIRECT: 15; total INJURIES INDIRECT: 30: tot } pli

11731,"Our analysis of the Tower of Hanoi led to the correct answer, but it
required an “inductive leap”; we relied on a lucky guess about the answer.
One of the main objectives of this book is to explain how a person can solve
recurrences without being clairvoyant. For example, we’ll see that recurrence
(1.1) can be simplified by adding 1 to both sides of the equations:

Tot 1 =1;
Ta +1 =2Tp-1 +2, for n > 0.

Now if we let U, = Ty, +1, we have

Up = 15

Un =2Un1,  forn >0. (2-3)

It doesn’t take genius to discover that the solution to this recurrence is just
U,, = 2""; hence T,, = 2"" — 1. Even a computer could discover this.

rid London of “street nuisances”’—organ grinders above all. These pests,
loving to get his goat, would come and serenade him at any time of day or
night, and he would furiously chase them down the street. Today, we
recognize in Babbage a man a hundred years ahead of his time: not only
inventor of the basic principles of modern computers, he was also one of
the first to battle noise pollution. :

I have been told of the significant development you have made
on merging multiple pages onto a single screen, which, I
understand, is the first time this has been done anywhere in
the world. My warmest congratulations to you and thanks for

Introduction

Each year there are more students taking Computer Science I, and the students are coming from a wider
range of university Programs. We in Computer Science would like to see this trend continue, since we
believe that computational thinking and programming are fundamental skills that all university students
should obtain. This year we have students from the following programs: Computer Science, Science,
Math and its Applications, Arts, Engineering, Financial Math, Business, RTA, Biomedical Science,
Graphic Commuication, International Economics, Creative Industries, Hospitality, Journalism, Media
Production, and Nutrition. Clearly there are applications for programming in all of these areas, and each
of you may have a problem in mind to which you would like to apply your new Python programming
skills. The problem might be from everyday life, like how long it will take to pay off a loan given the
interest rate and the payment schedule, or from your intended profession, or from your pass-time or your
other courses. In this first assignment, we ask you to choose or invent your own problem and solve it. If
you are unsure if the problem you propose is appropriate, please discuss it with your lab TA.

What to do:

1. Write a Python program, al.py with the following characteristics:
a) there are at least 20 lines of comments and 40 lines of code (1 point)
b) the problem is described at the top of the program in a readable fashion (1 point)
c) the code includes at least one instance of each of the five learning objectives listed above. (3 points)
d) the code solves the problem. This may be assessed in part by a ‘code walkthrough' where you explain
your code to the TA. (4 points) 3
2. Run your program and collect the output in a text file called output.txt (1 point)

What to hand in on D2L:

The two files: al.py and output.txt, as described above.

Question:

A Boolean expression, along with its solution is given below. (The single
quote symbol means complement/negation of that Boolean variable, the
plus sign is OR and if there is no symbol between two Boolean variables, it
means an AND operation between them). For each step in the solution,
correctly identify the property of Boolean Algebra that has been utilized to
reach the current step in the solution, by matching it with the correct
property from the given list. The properties have been labeled in the solution
with Roman numerals in parentheses at the end of each line.

What does the acronym RAM
mean?

The word RAM comes from the

acronym: Random Access Memory,.

It is called random access because
information can be loaded into memory
in any position, having the same access
time to that information whatever its
position may be, without the need to
follow an order to access the data,
which would be how its counterpart
works, through sequential access. This
translates into much faster access to

data and memory locations.

 

What is Ram memory for?
Basically for everything. Without RAM
the system would not start. The
operating system itself uses an amount

of memory just to start, and each

S A REST API is a way for two computer
programs to talk to each other over the
internet. One program, called the ""client,""
makes a request to the other program, called
the ""server,"" asking for some information or
action. The server then sends a response back
to the client with the information or result of
the action. This is a bit like when you ask your
mom or dad for something and they give you
an answer or do something for you. The ""API""
part of ""REST API"" stands for ""Application

that the two programs follow when they talk to

provide a daily summary of orders for the shop owner
Write and test a program or programs for the car shop owner.

¢ Your program or programs must include appropriate prompts for the entry of data

* Error messages and other output need to be set out Clearly and understandably

* All variables, constants and other identifiers must have meaningful names
You will need to complete these three tasks. Each task must be fully tested. .

TASK 1 — Produce an estimate.

Write a program for TASK 1 to calculate the cost of building a car using these components.

Prices in $

The customer makes a choice for each component and an estimate is produced. The estimate must show
a unique estimate number, the components chosen and the price of each component. The estimate must

also show the total cost of the car, which is calculated as the sum of the cost of the components chosen
plus $10,000.

TASK 2 — Place an order.

Using your estimate from TASK 1, check if the car components required are in stock. Update the stock
levels if all the car components are in stock. Add the unique estimate number to the list of order numbers.

TASK 3 — Summarise the day’s orders.

Extend TASK 2 to provide an end of day summary showing the number of orders made, the total number
of each component sold and the value of the orders.

You will not be productive if you
check your phone every time you

get a new notification

Put your phone away from you

If you want to learn a new concept
you need to focus on it

9116,"Given a set of n towns connected by roads with known lengths, find

the shortest path that passes through each town exactly once.

There is an obvious method of solution, which is to construct all
possible paths and calculate their lengths. With n towns, we will have
&*"" paths. This approach very quickly becomes intractable even for
relatively low values of n, as shown by Table 5.1. With only 61 towns,

there are more possible paths than atoms in the universe.

Table 5.1. Number of paths and estimated calulation time aso function ofthe numberof vertices. The numberof paths is comparable with
the estimated number of atoms in the visible universe, which is 10®, and the time required to enumerate all solutions is similar to the age of
the universe, which is 13.798 + 0.037 x 10° years

Faced with this problem of combinatorial explosion, we generally
choose to turn to approximate solutions, for which we can use
heuristics. There is a rich body of literature [LAP 92REG 11] on this

subject. We can classify heuristics into three categories:

Figure 27.2 A directed acyclic graph representing the computation of P-F1B(4). Each circle rep-
resents one strand, with black circles representing either base cases or the part of the procedure
(instance) up to the spawn of P-F1B(n — 1) in line 3, shaded circles representing the part of the pro-
cedure that calls P-F1B(n — 2) in line 4 up to the syne in line 5, where it suspends until the spawn of
P-F1B(n — 1) returns, and white circles representing the part of the procedure after the syne where
it sums x and y up to the point where it returns the result. Each group of strands belonging to the
same procedure is surrounded by a rounded rectangle, lightly shaded for spawned procedures and
heavily shaded for called procedures. Spawn edges and call edges point downward, continuation
edges point horizontally to the right, and return edges point upward. Assuming that each strand takes
unit time, the work equals 17 time units, since there are 17 strands, and the span is 8 time units, since
the critical path—shown with shaded edges—contains 8 strands.

PROBABILITY

FOR DATA SCIENCE

Probability is simply defined as a chance of something happening or likelihood of an
event is to be happened. Probability played a vital role in decision making that’s why
‘companies’ executive based on it before going to take any decision prior to
investment. An event can be likely or unlikely and having specific outcome or several
‘outcomes. Probability can be expressed numerically, percentage or fraction (33%,
1/6, 0.30).

General Formula
Probability of an event A is tes between
OsP(A)s1
IEP(A) > PCB) then event A is more Hey
to be occ ‘event B.
f P(B) then events A and B are
equally likely 10 be occurred.

Setup

Set the name and email that will be
attached to your commits and tags

$ git config --global
user.name ""Danny Adams""
$ git config --global
user.email ""my-
email@gmail.com""

Start a Project

Create a local repo (omit <directory>
to initialise the current directory as a
git repo

$ git init <directory>

Download a remote repo

$ git clone <url>

Make a Change

Add a file to staging

$ git add <file>

Stage all files

$ git add .

Commit all staged files to git

$ git commit -m ""commit
message""

Add all changes made to tracked files
& commit

$ git commit -am ""commit
message""

Basic Concepts

main: default development
branch

origin: default upstream repo
HEAD: current branch

HEAD’: parent of HEAD

HEAD~4: great-great
grandparent of HEAD

Branches

List all local branches. Add -r flag to
show all remote branches. -a flag for
all branches.

$ git branch
Create a new branch
$ git branch <new-branch>

Switch to a branch & update the
working directory

$ git checkout <branch>
Create a new branch and switch to it

$ git checkout -b <new-
branch>

Delete a merged branch
$ git branch -d <branch>

Delete a branch, whether merged or
not

$ git branch -D <branch>

Add a tag to current commit (often
used for new version releases)

$ git tag <tag-name>

Merging
Merge branch a into branch b. Add --

no-ff option for no-fast-forward
merge

oops""

New Merge Commit (no-ff)

$ git checkout b
$ git merge a

Merge & squash all commits into one
new commit

$ git merge --squash a

Rebasing

Rebase feature branch onto main (to
incorporate new changes made to
main). Prevents unnecessary merge
commits into feature, keeping history
clean

0005

$ git checkout feature
$ git rebase main

Interatively clean up a branches
commits before rebasing onto main

$ git rebase -i main

Interatively rebase the last 3 commits
on current branch

$ git rebase -i Head~3

Undoing Things
Move (&/or rename) a file & stage
move

$ git mv <existing_path>
<new_path>

Remove a file from working directory
& staging area, then stage the
removal

$ git rm <file>

Remove from staging area only

$ git rm --cached <file>
View a previous commit (READ only)
$ git checkout <commit_ID>

Create a new commit, reverting the
changes from a specified commit

$ git revert <commit_ID>

Go back to a previous commit &
delete all commits ahead of it (revert
is safer). Add --hard flag to also
delete workspace changes (BE VERY
CAREFUL)

$ git reset <commit_ID>

Review your Repo

List new or modified files not yet
committed

$ git status

List commit history, with respective
IDs

$ git log --oneline

Show changes to unstaged files. For
changes to staged files, add --cached
option

$ git diff
Show changes between two commits
$ git diff commit1_ID

commit2_ID

Stashing

Store modified & staged changes. To
include untracked files, add -u flag.
For untracked & ignored files, add -a
flag.

$ git stash
As above, but add a comment.
$ git stash save ""comment""

Partial stash. Stash just a single file, a
collection of files, or individual
changes from within files

$ git stash -p

List all stashes

$ git stash list

Re-apply the stash without deleting it
$ git stash apply

Re-apply the stash at index 2, then
delete it from the stash list. Omit
stash@{n} to pop the most recent
stash.

$ git stash pop stash@{2}

Show the diff summary of stash 1.
Pass the -p flag to see the full diff.

$ git stash show stash@{1}

Delete stash at index 1. Omit
stash@{n} to delete last stash made

$ git stash drop stash@{1}
Delete all stashes

$ git stash clear

Synchronizing
Add a remote repo

$ git remote add <alias>
<url>

View all remote connections. Add -v
flag to view urls.

$ git remote

Remove a connection

$ git remote remove <alias>
Rename a connection

$ git remote rename <old>
<new>

Fetch all branches from remote repo
(no merge)

$ git fetch <alias>
Fetch a specific branch
$ git fetch <alias> <branch>

Fetch the remote repo's copy of the
current branch, then merge

$ git pull

Move (rebase) your local changes
onto the top of new changes made to
the remote repo (for clean, linear
history)

$ git pull --rebase <alias>
Upload local content to remote repo
$ git push <alias>

Upload to a branch (can then pull
request)

$ git push <alias> <branch>

PREPROCESSING

   

Getting Started with Machine Learning

Gy

Step 1: Importing the required

Libraries
Bruny i

These Two are essential libraries which we will import
every time

Pandas NumPy is a Library which contains Mathematical
functions,
Pandas is the library used to import and manage the
data sets

Step 2: Importing the Data Set

Data sets are generally available in csv format. A CSV
file stores tabular data in plain text. Each line of the file
is a data record. We use the read_csv method of the
pandas library to read a local CSV file as a dataframe
Then we make separate Matrix and Vector of
independent and dependent variables from the
dataframe.

Step 3: Handling the Missing Data
The data we get is rarely homogeneous. Data can be
missing due to various reasons and needs to be

a handled so that it does not reduce the performance of
our machine learning model. We can replace the
missing data by the Mean or Median of the entire

column. We use Imputer class of sklearn.preprocessing
for this task

Step 4: Encoding Categorical Data
Categorical data are variables that contain label values
rather than numeric values. The number of possible
Q values is often limited to a fixed set. Example values
COG Sich as Yes: ana No cannot be used in mathematical
equations of the model so we need to encode these

variables into numbers, To achieve this we import
LabelEncoder class from sklearn preprocessing library.

Step 5: Splitting the dataset into test

set and training set

We make two partitions of dataset one for training the
model called training set and other for testing the
performance of the trained model called test set. The
split is generally 80/20. We import train_test_split()
method of sklearn.crossvalidation library,

Step 6: Feature Scaling
Most of the machine learning algorithms use the
A Euclidean distance between two data points in their
4 computations, features highly varying in magnitudes.

units and range pose problems. High magnitudes

Zz features will weigh more in the distance calculations
than features with low magnitudes. Done by Feature
standardization or Z-score normalization. StandardScalar
of sklearn preprocessing is imported.

Advantages of
Computer Science

4) Multitasking

One of the primary benefits of a computer is the
ability to multitask.

(2) Speed

One of the most significant benefits of computers
is their remarkable speed.

€) (6feks)1

The main benefit of having a centralised database
for keeping information is that it will save money.

4) Accurate

A computer can execute computations not just
quickly but also accurately.

5) Dependency

Due to exhaustion or boredom, which are both

typical in people, results may contain errors.

Computers can accomplish the same type of
cece ya again and again without mistakes.

Complete the program listed below. The program inputs
five numbers, outputs them, then outputs them again. The
second time the numbers are output, they should be ""rotated""
to the left; that is, the number that was at the front (left end) of
the list should be moved to the (right-hand) end, and all the
other numbers in the list should be moved one position to the
left (toward the front of the list).. Do not change any of the
given statements; instead, add instructions between the two
output statements to rotate the contents of the five variables.
You may define one additional variable. Avoid extra,
unnecessary instructions. Here is a sample run:

Enter five numbers: 8 11 5 9 7

 

Before rotating: 8 11 5 9 7

 

After rotating: 11 5 9 7 8

 

Enter five numbers: 3.5 20 8.25 17
12.4

 

Before rotating: 3.5 20 8.25 17 12.4

 

After rotating: 20 8.25 17 12.4 3.5

 

Here's the program to complete:
int main()

 

{

 

double a, b, c, d, e|

 

cout << ""Enter five numbers: "";

 

cin >> a>>b>>c>>d>>e;

 

cout << endl;

 

 

cout << ""Before rotating: "" << a<< ""
""<< b<< ""oo""
<< co <<"" ""<< d <<"" ""<< e <<
endl;

 

// Add additional statements here to
rotate the numbers in the five variables.

 

// Do NOT change any existing
statements, including the output
statements.

 

// Do NOT add any input or output
statements.

Portable

Structured
programming
language

Memory
Management

RICH
LIBRARY

 

Cis called a mid-level programming
language. It can develop drivers, kernels,
etc.

Cis a portable or machine-independent

language. We can execute C programs on
different machines with minor changes.

C program is breakable into parts by
using functions that makes it easy to
understand and reuse.

C supports dynamic memory allocation.
That means the memory can be freed
anytime by calling the free() function.

 

Chas a very rich library as it has

several inbuilt functions that help is
fast development.

7995,"This formulation of the concept of an algorithm does not include the re-
striction of effectiveness mentioned earlier. For example, Q might denote infinite
sequences that are not computable by pencil and paper methods, or f might
involve operations that mere mortals cannot always perform. If we wish to
restrict the notion of algorithm so that only elementary operations are involved,
we can place restrictions on Q, J, 9, and f, for example as follows: Let A be
a finite set of letters, and let A* be the set of all strings on A (the set of all
ordered sequences 21%2...2%n, where n > 0 and g; is in A for 1 < j <n). The
idea is to encode the states of the computation so that they are represented by
strings of A*. Now let N be a nonnegative integer and let Q be the set of all
(o,7), where o is in A* and j is an integer, 0 < j < N; let I be the subset of Q
with j = 0 and let Q be the subset with j = N. If 6 and o are strings in A*, we
say that @ occurs in o if o has the form aéw for strings a and w. To complete
our definition, let f be a function of the following type, defined by the strings
6;, oj and the integers a;, b; for0O <j < N:

f(9,9)=(¢,4;) if 0; does not occur in a;
f(o,j)=(adjw,b;) if a is the shortest possible string for which o =a6jw;
f(o,N)=(o,N). (3)

Such a computational method is clearly effective, and experience shows
that it is also powerful enough to do anything we can do by hand. There are
many other essentially equivalent ways to formulate the concept of an effective

computational method (for example, using Turing machines). The formulation
above is virtually the same as that given by A. A. Markov in his book The

improvement is based on a reduction to and an analysis of a problem from extremal graph
theory: we show that for any graph with n vertices, the product of the number of its
cliques with the number of its cocliques (independent sets) is bounded by (n + 1)2"".

The proof consists of two parts. First, it is proved that the algorithm produces a spanning tree. Second, it is proved that the constructed spanning tree is of minimal weight.

Spanning tree [edit]
Let G be a connected, weighted graph and let Y be the subgraph of G produced by the algorithm. Y cannot have a cycle, as by definition an edge is not added if it results in a cycle. Y cannot be
disconnected, since the first encountered edge that joins two components of Y would have been added by the algorithm. Thus, Y is a spanning tree of G.

Tips for New

DEVELOPERS

1. Have your reason and remember it

Programming is hard, and you will get frustrated sometimes. At those times,
itwill be essential to keep in mind the reason you started coding in the first
place.

 

2. Find a community

Find a community to support you as you start writing code. This can be a
‘meetup, an online forum, or even a blogging platform like devo,

3. Embrace the cycle of learning

If you're learning to code as a second career, especially if you've been away
from the classroom for a while, learning how to learns going to be abig part
‘of your process, There are lots of ups and downs involved, which is very
natural! Brace yourself for that rollercoaster before starting out.

 

 

4, Start with free resources

‘There area million and one resources for learning how to code. Some are
free, and some are paid. | would start with the free resources, make sure you
like writing code, and then after that. you could think about moving onto
paid resources or even a bootcamp.

5. Get good at pattern recognition

Recognizing patterns in code is one of the most important skills you can
have. When people talk about writing ""DRY"" code (ie., Don't Repeat
Yourself) they are talking about reducing the patterns in your code,

6. Struggle, but not too much

Struggling alittle bit when you are learningis really important so that you
‘can solve the problem yourself and find an answer using resources that exis.
‘That being said, it can become unproductive and demotivating to struggle
with a problem for too long. After a few hours, reach out to someone for
help!

7. You don't need to know everything

Itis straight up 100% impossible to know everything about programming.
Nobody knows every programming language, every single method that's out
there, every library and framework, or the perfect solution to every problem,
Don't worry about learning everything, just focus on what you do know and
‘extending that.

8. Compare yourself to only yourself

ing to code out there, Don't compare your
tead compare yourself to previous you and

‘There are alot of people leai
progress to someone else's
focus on your own growth.
